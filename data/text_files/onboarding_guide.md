## User Onboarding Manual

### Introduction
The onboarding flow helps new users get started quickly by verifying identity and setting up
initial preferences. Users must verify their email before accessing premium features.

### Dashboard Overview
The dashboard contains modules for analytics, billing, user settings, integration management,
and usage insights. Each module includes contextual tooltips to guide new users.

### Troubleshooting
If email verification fails, users should:
- Check spam or promotions folder
- Ensure the email address is typed correctly
- Request a new verification link (expires in 15 minutes)
- Contact support if the issue persists
