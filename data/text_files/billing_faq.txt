Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled before the next billing cycle. Auto-renewal
can be turned off from the Billing Settings page. Once disabled, users retain access until the
end of the current billing period.

Refunds for auto-renewals are provided only if the request is submitted within 48 hours.
Proration is not supported. Failed transactions may temporarily restrict access until payment
is completed.

Invoices are available for download under Account → Billing → Invoices.
