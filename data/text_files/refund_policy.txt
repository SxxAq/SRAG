Our refund policy allows customers to request a refund within 30 days of purchase.
Refunds are processed within 5–7 business days after approval. Physical products must
be returned in original packaging, while digital products are eligible for refunds only
in cases where technical issues cannot be resolved by our support team.

Customers must submit a refund request through the support portal. Once submitted, our
team reviews the request and may ask for transaction details or additional verification.
Repeated refund requests for the same product may result in account restrictions.
