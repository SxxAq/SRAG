Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to train models, enabling tasks such as 
classification, regression, and prediction. Common algorithms include Logistic Regression, 
Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data and aims to uncover hidden patterns.
Key techniques include clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN), dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE),
and association rule mining (Apriori, FP-Growth). The selection of approach depends on 
data availability and the problem type.

In modern machine learning systems, semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning
bridge the gap by leveraging a small amount of labeled data with large volumes of unlabelled data.
