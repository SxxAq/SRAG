Iron deficiency commonly leads to fatigue, pale skin, frequent headaches, dizziness, 
and brittle nails. Severe deficiency may result in iron-deficiency anemia.

Diagnosis typically involves hemoglobin tests, ferritin level checks, and evaluation of
dietary habits. Treatment includes iron supplements, vitamin C intake for improved 
absorption, and increased consumption of leafy vegetables, red meat, and beans.

If untreated, long-term iron deficiency can cause cognitive impairment and reduced immunity.
