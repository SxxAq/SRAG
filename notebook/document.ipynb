One of these fossils is the Smilodon, or saber-toothed tiger, instantly\\nrecognizable by its long canines. Five million years ago or so, a completely different\\nsaber-tooth tiger called Thylacosmilus lived\\nin Argentina and other parts of South Amer-\\nica. Thylacosmilus was a marsupial whereas\\nSmilodon was a placental mammal, but Thy-\\nlacosmilus had the same long upper canines\\nand, like Smilodon, had a protective bone\\nﬂange on the lower jaw. The similarity of\\nthese two mammals is one of many examples\\nof parallel or convergent evolution, in which particular contexts or environments\\nlead to the evolution of very similar structures in different species (Gould, 1980).\\nThe role of context is also important in the similarity of a less biological kind\\nof organism: the word. Words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar\\nmeanings. This link between similarity in how words are distributed and similarity\\nin what they mean is called the distributional hypothesis. The hypothesis wasdistributional\\nhypothesis\\nﬁrst formulated in the 1950s by linguists like Joos (1950), Harris (1954), and Firth\\n(1957), who noticed that words which are synonyms (like oculist and eye-doctor)\\ntended to occur in the same environment (e.g., near words like eye or examined)\\nwith the amount of meaning difference between two words “corresponding roughly\\nto the amount of difference in their environments” (Harris, 1954, p. 157).\\nIn this chapter we introduce embeddings, vector representations of the meaningembeddings\\nof words that are learned directly from word distributions in texts.

How should\\nwe represent the meaning of a word? In the n-gram models of Chapter 3, and in\\nclassical NLP applications, our only representation of a word is as a string of letters,\\nor an index in a vocabulary list. This representation is not that different from a\\ntradition in philosophy, perhaps you’ve seen it in introductory logic classes, in which\\nthe meaning of words is represented by just spelling the word with small capital\\nletters; representing the meaning of “dog” as DOG , and “cat” as CAT, or by using an\\napostrophe (DOG ’).\\nRepresenting the meaning of a word by capitalizing it is a pretty unsatisfactory\\nmodel. You might have seen a version of a joke due originally to semanticist Barbara\\nPartee (Carlson, 1977):\\nQ: What’s the meaning of life?\\nA: LIFE ’\\nSurely we can do better than this! After all, we’ll want a model of word meaning\\nto do all sorts of things for us. It should tell us that some words have similar mean-\\nings (cat is similar to dog), others are antonyms (cold is the opposite of hot), some\\nhave positive connotations (happy) while others have negative connotations (sad). It\\nshould represent the fact that the meanings of buy, sell, and pay offer differing per-\\nspectives on the same underlying purchasing event. (If I buy something from you,\\nyou’ve probably sold it to me, and I likely paid you.) More generally, a model of\\nword meaning should allow us to draw inferences to address meaning-related tasks\\nlike question-answering or dialogue.\\nIn this section we summarize some of these desiderata, drawing on results in the\\nlinguistic study of word meaning, which is called lexical semantics; we’ll return tolexical\\nsemantics\\nand expand on this list in Appendix G and Chapter 21.\\nLemmas and Senses Let’s start by looking at how one word (we’ll choosemouse)\\nmight be deﬁned in a dictionary (simpliﬁed from the online dictionary WordNet):\\nmouse (N)\\n1. any of numerous small rodents...\\n2. a hand-operated device that controls a cursor...\\nHere the form mouse is the lemma, also called the citation form. The formlemma\\ncitation form mouse would also be the lemma for the word mice; dictionaries don’t have separate\\ndeﬁnitions for inﬂected forms like mice. Similarly sing is the lemma for sing, sang,\\nsung. In many languages the inﬁnitive form is used as the lemma for the verb, so\\nSpanish dormir “to sleep” is the lemma forduermes “you sleep”. The speciﬁc forms\\nsung or carpets or sing or duermes are called wordforms.wordform\\nAs the example above shows, each lemma can have multiple meanings; the\\nlemma mouse can refer to the rodent or the cursor control device. We call each\\nof these aspects of the meaning of mouse a word sense. The fact that lemmas can\\nbe polysemous (have multiple senses) can make interpretation difﬁcult (is some-\\none who searches for “mouse info” looking for a pet or a widget?). Chapter 10\\nand Appendix G will discuss the problem of polysemy, and introduce word sense\\ndisambiguation, the task of determining which sense of a word is being used in a\\nparticular context.\\nSynonymy One important component of word meaning is the relationship be-\\ntween word senses. For example when one word has a sense whose meaning is'),\n",

Synonyms include such pairs assynonym\\ncouch/sofa vomit/throw up ﬁlbert/hazelnut car/automobile\\nA more formal deﬁnition of synonymy (between words rather than senses) is that\\ntwo words are synonymous if they are substitutable for one another in any sentence\\nwithout changing the truth conditions of the sentence, the situations in which the\\nsentence would be true.\\nWhile substitutions between some pairs of words like car / automobile or wa-\\nter / H2O are truth preserving, the words are still not identical in meaning. Indeed,\\nprobably no two words are absolutely identical in meaning. One of the fundamental\\ntenets of semantics, called theprinciple of contrast(Girard 1718, Br´eal 1897, Clarkprinciple of\\ncontrast\\n1987), states that a difference in linguistic form is always associated with some dif-\\nference in meaning. For example, the word H2O is used in scientiﬁc contexts and\\nwould be inappropriate in a hiking guide— water would be more appropriate— and\\nthis genre difference is part of the meaning of the word. In practice, the word syn-\\nonym is therefore used to describe a relationship of approximate or rough synonymy.\\nWord Similarity While words don’t have many synonyms, most words do have\\nlots of similar words. Cat is not a synonym of dog, but cats and dogs are certainly\\nsimilar words. In moving from synonymy to similarity, it will be useful to shift from\\ntalking about relations between word senses (like synonymy) to relations between\\nwords (like similarity). Dealing with words avoids having to commit to a particular\\nrepresentation of word senses, which will turn out to simplify our task.\\nThe notion of word similarity is very useful in larger semantic tasks. Knowingsimilarity\\nhow similar two words are can help in computing how similar the meaning of two\\nphrases or sentences are, a very important component of tasks like question answer-\\ning, paraphrasing, and summarization. One way of getting values for word similarity\\nis to ask humans to judge how similar one word is to another. A number of datasets\\nhave resulted from such experiments. For example the SimLex-999 dataset (Hill\\net al., 2015) gives values on a scale from 0 to 10, like the examples below, which\\nrange from near-synonyms ( vanish, disappear) to pairs that scarcely seem to have\\nanything in common (hole, agreement):\\nvanish disappear 9.8\\nbelief impression 5.95\\nmuscle bone 3.65\\nmodest ﬂexible 0.98\\nhole agreement 0.3\\nWord Relatedness The meaning of two words can be related in ways other than\\nsimilarity. One such class of connections is called word relatedness (Budanitskyrelatedness\\nand Hirst, 2006), also traditionally called word association in psychology.association\\nConsider the meanings of the words coffee and cup. Coffee is not similar to cup;\\nthey share practically no features (coffee is a plant or a beverage, while a cup is a\\nmanufactured object with a particular shape). But coffee and cup are clearly related;\\nthey are associated by co-participating in an everyday event (the event of drinking\\ncoffee out of a cup). Similarly scalpel and surgeon are not similar but are related\\neventively (a surgeon tends to make use of a scalpel).\\nOne common kind of relatedness between words is if they belong to the same\\nsemantic ﬁeld. A semantic ﬁeld is a set of words which cover a particular semanticsemantic ﬁeld\\ndomain and bear structured relations with each other. For example, words might be'),\n",

Semantic ﬁelds are also related to topic models, like Latenttopic models\\nDirichlet Allocation, LDA, which apply unsupervised learning on large sets of texts\\nto induce sets of associated words from text. Semantic ﬁelds and topic models are\\nvery useful tools for discovering topical structure in documents.\\nIn Appendix G we’ll introduce more relations between senses like hypernymy\\nor IS-A, antonymy (opposites) and meronymy (part-whole relations).\\nConnotation Finally, words have affective meanings or connotations. The wordconnotations\\nconnotation has different meanings in different ﬁelds, but here we use it to mean the\\naspects of a word’s meaning that are related to a writer or reader’s emotions, senti-\\nment, opinions, or evaluations. For example some words have positive connotations\\n(wonderful) while others have negative connotations ( dreary). Even words whose\\nmeanings are similar in other ways can vary in connotation; consider the difference\\nin connotations between fake, knockoff, forgery, on the one hand, and copy, replica,\\nreproduction on the other, or innocent (positive connotation) and naive (negative\\nconnotation). Some words describe positive evaluation (great, love) and others neg-\\native evaluation (terrible, hate). Positive or negative evaluation language is called\\nsentiment, as we saw in Appendix K, and word sentiment plays a role in impor-sentiment\\ntant tasks like sentiment analysis, stance detection, and applications of NLP to the\\nlanguage of politics and consumer reviews.\\nEarly work on affective meaning (Osgood et al., 1957) found that words varied\\nalong three important dimensions of affective meaning:\\nvalence: the pleasantness of the stimulus\\narousal: the intensity of emotion provoked by the stimulus\\ndominance: the degree of control exerted by the stimulus\\nThus words like happy or satisﬁed are high on valence, while unhappy or an-\\nnoyed are low on valence. Excited is high on arousal, while calm is low on arousal.\\nControlling is high on dominance, while awed or inﬂuenced are low on dominance.\\nEach word is thus represented by three numbers, corresponding to its value on each\\nof the three dimensions:\\nValence Arousal Dominance\\ncourageous 8.0 5.5 7.4\\nmusic 7.7 5.6 6.5\\nheartbreak 2.5 5.7 3.6\\ncub 6.7 4.0 4.2\\nOsgood et al. (1957) noticed that in using these 3 numbers to represent the\\nmeaning of a word, the model was representing each word as a point in a three-\\ndimensional space, a vector whose three dimensions corresponded to the word’s\\nrating on the three scales.

This sim-\\nplest vector model of meaning is based on the co-occurrence matrix, a way of rep-\\nresenting how often words co-occur. We’ll deﬁne a particular kind of co-occurrence\\nmatrix, the word-context matrix, in which each row in the matrix represents a wordword-context\\nmatrix\\nin the vocabulary and each column represents how often each other word in the vo-\\ncabulary appears nearby.

We could implement various methods, but let’s\\nstart with a very simple one: a context window around the word, let’s say of 4 words\\nto the left and 4 words to the right. If we do that, each cell will represents the\\nnumber of times (in some training corpus) the column word occurs in such a ±4\\nword window around the row word.\\nLet’s see how this works for 4 words: cherry, strawberry, digital, and informa-\\ntion.

And the vectors are dense: instead of vector entries\\nbeing sparse, mostly-zero counts or functions of counts, the values will be real-\\nvalued numbers that can be negative.\\nIt turns out that dense vectors work better in every NLP task than sparse vectors.\\nWhile we don’t completely understand all the reasons for this, we have some intu-\\nitions. Representing words as 300-dimensional dense vectors requires our classiﬁers\\nto learn far fewer weights than if we represented words as 50,000-dimensional vec-\\ntors, and the smaller parameter space possibly helps with generalization and avoid-\\ning overﬁtting. Dense vectors may also do a better job of capturing synonymy.\\nFor example, in a sparse vector representation, dimensions for synonyms like car\\nand automobile dimension are distinct and unrelated; sparse vectors may thus fail\\nto capture the similarity between a word with car as a neighbor and a word with\\nautomobile as a neighbor.\\nIn this section we introduce one method for computing embeddings: skip-gramskip-gram\\nwith negative sampling, sometimes called SGNS.

It begins by assigning a random embedding vector\\nfor each of the N vocabulary words, and then proceeds to iteratively shift the em-\\nbedding of each word w to be more like the embeddings of words that occur nearby\\nin texts, and less like the embeddings of words that don’t occur nearby. Let’s start\\nby considering a single piece of training data:\\n... lemon, a [tablespoon of apricot jam, a] pinch ...\\nc1 c2 w c3 c4\\nThis example has a target word w (apricot), and 4 context words in the L = ±2\\nwindow, resulting in 4 positive training instances (on the left below):\\npositive examples +\\nw c pos\\napricot tablespoon\\napricot of\\napricot jam\\napricot a\\nnegative examples -\\nw c neg w c neg\\napricot aardvark apricot seven\\napricot my apricot forever\\napricot where apricot dear\\napricot coaxial apricot if\\nFor training a binary classiﬁer we also need negative examples. In fact skip-\\ngram with negative sampling (SGNS) uses more negative examples than positive\\nexamples (with the ratio between them set by a parameter k). So for each of these\\n(w,cpos) training instances we’ll create k negative samples, each consisting of the\\ntarget w plus a ‘noise word’cneg. A noise word is a random word from the lexicon,\\nconstrained not to be the target word w. The table right above shows the setting\\nwhere k = 2, so we’ll have 2 negative examples in the negative training set −for\\neach positive example w,cpos.\\nThe noise words are chosen according to their weighted unigram probability\\npα (w), where α is a weight. If we were sampling according to unweighted proba-\\nbility P(w), it would mean that with unigram probabilityP(“the”) we would choose\\nthe word the as a noise word, with unigram probability P(“aardvark”) we would\\nchoose aardvark, and so on.

A related problem is word\\nsparsity, such as in languages with rich morphology, where some of the many forms\\nfor each noun and verb may only occur rarely. Fasttext deals with these problems\\nby using subword models, representing each word as itself plus a bag of constituent\\nn-grams, with special boundary symbols< and > added to each word. For example,\\nwith n = 3 the word where would be represented by the sequence <where> plus the\\ncharacter n-grams:\\n<wh, whe, her, ere, re>\\nThen a skipgram embedding is learned for each constituent n-gram, and the word\\nwhere is represented by the sum of all of the embeddings of its constituent n-grams.\\nUnknown words can then be presented only by the sum of the constituent n-grams.\\nA fasttext open-source library, including pretrained embeddings for 157 languages,\\nis available at https://fasttext.cc.\\nAnother very widely used static embedding model is GloVe (Pennington et al.,\\n2014), short for Global Vectors, because the model is based on capturing global\\ncorpus statistics. GloVe is based on ratios of probabilities from the word-word co-\\noccurrence matrix.\\nIt turns out that dense embeddings like word2vec actually have an elegant math-\\nematical relationship with count-based embeddings, in which word2vec can be seen\\nas implicitly optimizing a function of a count matrix with a particular (PPMI) weight-\\ning (Levy and Goldberg, 2014c).\\n5.6 Visualizing Embeddings\\n“I see well in many dimensions as long as the dimensions are around two.”\\nThe late economist Martin Shubik\\nVisualizing embeddings is an important goal in helping understand, apply, and\\nimprove these models of word meaning.

Fig. 5.1 showed one such visualization, as does\\nFig. 5.9, using a projection method called t-SNE (van der\\nMaaten and Hinton, 2008).\\n5.7 Semantic properties of embeddings\\nIn this section we brieﬂy summarize some of the semantic properties of embeddings\\nthat have been studied.\\nDifferent types of similarity or association: One parameter of vector semantic\\nmodels that is relevant to both sparse PPMI vectors and dense word2vec vectors is\\nthe size of the context window used to collect counts. This is generally between 1\\nand 10 words on each side of the target word (for a total context of 2-20 words).\\nThe choice depends on the goals of the representation. Shorter context windows\\ntend to lead to representations that are a bit more syntactic, since the information is\\ncoming from immediately nearby words. When the vectors are computed from short\\ncontext windows, the most similar words to a target word w tend to be semantically\\nsimilar words with the same parts of speech. When vectors are computed from long\\ncontext windows, the highest cosine words to a target word w tend to be words that\\nare topically related but not similar.\\nFor example Levy and Goldberg (2014a) showed that using skip-gram with a\\nwindow of ±2, the most similar words to the wordHogwarts (from the Harry Potter\\nseries) were names of other ﬁctional schools: Sunnydale (from Buffy the Vampire\\nSlayer) or Evernight (from a vampire series). With a window of±5, the most similar\\nwords to Hogwarts were other words topically related to the Harry Potter series:\\nDumbledore, Malfoy, and half-blood.\\nIt’s also often useful to distinguish two kinds of similarity or association between\\nwords (Sch ¨utze and Pedersen, 1993). Two words have ﬁrst-order co-occurrenceﬁrst-order\\nco-occurrence\\n(sometimes called syntagmatic association) if they are typically nearby each other.\\nThus wrote is a ﬁrst-order associate ofbook or poem. Two words havesecond-order\\nco-occurrence (sometimes called paradigmatic association) if they have similarsecond-order\\nco-occurrence\\nneighbors. Thus wrote is a second-order associate of words like said or remarked.\\nAnalogy/Relational Similarity: Another semantic property of embeddings is their\\nability to capture relational meanings. In an important early vector space model of\\ncognition, Rumelhart and Abrahamson (1973) proposed the parallelogram modelparallelogram\\nmodel\\nfor solving simple analogy problems of the form a is to b as a* is to what?. In such\\nproblems, a system is given a problem like apple:tree::grape:?, i.e., apple is to tree\\nas grape is to , and must ﬁll in the word vine. In the parallelogram model, il-\\nlustrated in Fig. 5.8, the vector from the wordapple to the word tree (= #   »tree−#       »apple)\\nis added to the vector for grape (#        »grape); the nearest word to that point is returned.\\nIn early work with sparse embeddings, scholars showed that sparse vector mod-\\nels of meaning could solve such analogy problems (Turney and Littman, 2005),\\nbut the parallelogram method received more modern attention because of its suc-\\ncess with word2vec or GloVe vectors (Mikolov et al. 2013c, Levy and Goldberg\\n2014b, Pennington et al. 2014). For example, the result of the expression #     »king −#     »man + #            »woman is a vector close to #         »queen. Similarly, #      »Paris −#           »France + #     »Italy results\\nin a vector that is close to #         »Rome. The embedding model thus seems to be extract-'),\n",

As\\nthe prior section just showed, embeddings can roughly model relational similar-\\nity: ‘queen’ as the closest word to ‘king’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ implies the analogy\\nman:woman::king:queen. But these same embedding analogies also exhibit gender\\nstereotypes. For example Bolukbasi et al. (2016) ﬁnd that the closest occupation\\nto ‘computer programmer’ - ‘man’ + ‘woman’ in word2vec embeddings trained on\\nnews text is ‘homemaker’, and that the embeddings similarly suggest the analogy\\n‘father’ is to ‘doctor’ as ‘mother’ is to ‘nurse’. This could result in what Crawford\\n(2017) and Blodgett et al. (2020) call an allocational harm, when a system allo-allocational\\nharm\\ncates resources (jobs or credit) unfairly to different groups. For example algorithms\\nthat use embeddings as part of a search for hiring potential programmers or doctors\\nmight thus incorrectly downweight documents with women’s names.\\nIt turns out that embeddings don’t just reﬂect the statistics of their input, but also\\namplify bias; gendered terms become more gendered in embedding space than theybias\\nampliﬁcation\\nwere in the input text statistics (Zhao et al. 2017, Ethayarajh et al. 2019b, Jia et al.\\n2020), and biases are more exaggerated than in actual labor employment statistics\\n(Garg et al., 2018).\\nEmbeddings also encode the implicit associations that are a property of human\\nreasoning.

These problems with embeddings are an example of a repre-\\nsentational harm (Crawford 2017, Blodgett et al. 2020), which is a harm caused byrepresentational\\nharm\\na system demeaning or even ignoring some social groups. Any embedding-aware al-\\ngorithm that made use of word sentiment could thus exacerbate bias against African\\nAmericans.\\nRecent research focuses on ways to try to remove these kinds of biases, for\\nexample by developing a transformation of the embedding space that removes gen-\\nder stereotypes but preserves deﬁnitional gender (Bolukbasi et al. 2016, Zhao et al.\\n2017) or changing the training procedure (Zhao et al., 2018). However, although\\nthese sorts of debiasing may reduce bias in embeddings, they do not eliminate itdebiasing\\n(Gonen and Goldberg, 2019), and this remains an open problem.\\nHistorical embeddings are also being used to measure biases in the past. Garg\\net al. (2018) used embeddings from historical texts to measure the association be-\\ntween embeddings for occupations and embeddings for names of various ethnici-\\nties or genders (for example the relative cosine similarity of women’s names versus\\nmen’s to occupation words like ‘librarian’ or ‘carpenter’) across the 20th century.\\nThey found that the cosines correlate with the empirical historical percentages of\\nwomen or ethnic groups in those occupations. Historical embeddings also repli-\\ncated old surveys of ethnic stereotypes; the tendency of experimental participants in\\n1933 to associate adjectives like ‘industrious’ or ‘superstitious’ with, e.g., Chinese\\nethnicity, correlates with the cosine between Chinese last names and those adjectives\\nusing embeddings trained on 1930s text. They also were able to document historical\\ngender biases, such as the fact that embeddings for adjectives related to competence\\n(‘smart’, ‘wise’, ‘thoughtful’, ‘resourceful’) had a higher cosine with male than fe-\\nmale words, and showed that this bias has been slowly decreasing since 1960. We\\nreturn in later chapters to this question about the role of bias in natural language\\nprocessing.\\n5.9 Evaluating Vector Models\\nThe most important evaluation metric for vector models is extrinsic evaluation on\\ntasks, i.e., using vectors in an NLP task and seeing whether this improves perfor-\\nmance over some other model.\\n3 Roughly speaking, if humans associate ‘ﬂowers’ with ‘pleasantness’ and ‘insects’ with ‘unpleasant-\\nness’, when they are instructed to push a green button for ‘ﬂowers’ (daisy, iris, lilac) and ‘pleasant words’\\n(love, laughter, pleasure) and a red button for ‘insects’ (ﬂea, spider, mosquito) and ‘unpleasant words’\\n(abuse, hatred, ugly) they are faster than in an incongruous condition where they push a red button for\\n‘ﬂowers’ and ‘unpleasant words’ and a green button for ‘insects’ and ‘pleasant words’.'),\n",

The most common metric\\nis to test their performance on similarity, computing the correlation between an\\nalgorithm’s word similarity scores and word similarity ratings assigned by humans.\\nWordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2002) is a commonly used set of ratings from 0\\nto 10 for 353 noun pairs; for example ( plane, car) had an average score of 5.77.\\nSimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2015) is a more complex dataset that quantiﬁes similarity\\n(cup, mug) rather than relatedness ( cup, coffee), and includes concrete and abstract\\nadjective, noun and verb pairs. The TOEFL dataset is a set of 80 questions, each\\nconsisting of a target word with 4 additional word choices; the task is to choose\\nwhich is the correct synonym, as in the example: Levied is closest in meaning to:\\nimposed, believed, requested, correlated(Landauer and Dumais, 1997). All of these\\ndatasets present words without context.\\nSlightly more realistic are intrinsic similarity tasks that include context. The\\nStanford Contextual Word Similarity (SCWS) dataset (Huang et al., 2012) and the\\nWord-in-Context (WiC) dataset (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) offer richer\\nevaluation scenarios. SCWS gives human judgments on 2,003 pairs of words in\\ntheir sentential context, while WiC gives target words in two sentential contexts that\\nare either in the same or different senses; see Appendix G. The semantic textual\\nsimilarity task (Agirre et al. 2012, Agirre et al. 2015) evaluates the performance of\\nsentence-level similarity algorithms, consisting of a set of pairs of sentences, each\\npair with human-labeled similarity scores.\\nAnother task used for evaluation is the analogy task, discussed on page 17, where\\nthe system has to solve problems of the forma is to b as a* is to b*, givena, b, and a*\\nand having to ﬁnd b* (Turney and Littman, 2005). A number of sets of tuples have\\nbeen created for this task (Mikolov et al. 2013a, Mikolov et al. 2013c, Gladkova\\net al. 2016), covering morphology ( city:cities::child:children), lexicographic rela-\\ntions (leg:table::spout:teapot) and encyclopedia relations (Beijing:China::Dublin:Ireland),\\nsome drawing from the SemEval-2012 Task 2 dataset of 79 different relations (Jur-\\ngens et al., 2012).\\nAll embedding algorithms suffer from inherent variability. For example because\\nof randomness in the initialization and the random negative sampling, algorithms\\nlike word2vec may produce different results even from the same dataset, and in-\\ndividual documents in a collection may strongly impact the resulting embeddings\\n(Tian et al. 2016, Hellrich and Hahn 2016, Antoniak and Mimno 2018). When em-\\nbeddings are used to study word associations in particular corpora, therefore, it is\\nbest practice to train multiple embeddings with bootstrap sampling over documents\\nand average the results (Antoniak and Mimno, 2018).\\n5.10 Summary\\n• In vector semantics, a word is modeled as a vector—a point in high-dimensional\\nspace, also called an embedding. In this chapter we focus on static embed-\\ndings, where each word is mapped to a ﬁxed embedding.\\n• Vector semantic models fall into two classes: sparse and dense. In sparse\\nmodels each dimension corresponds to a word in the vocabulary V and cells\\nare functions of co-occurrence counts. The word-context or term-term ma-\\ntrix has a row for each (target) word in the vocabulary and a column for each\\ncontext term in the vocabulary.'),\n",

The cosine\\nof two vectors—a normalized dot product—is the most popular such metric.\\nHistorical Notes\\nThe idea of vector semantics arose out of research in the 1950s in three distinct\\nﬁelds: linguistics, psychology, and computer science, each of which contributed a\\nfundamental aspect of the model.\\nThe idea that meaning is related to the distribution of words in context was\\nwidespread in linguistic theory of the 1950s, among distributionalists like Zellig\\nHarris, Martin Joos, and J. R. Firth, and semioticians like Thomas Sebeok. As Joos\\n(1950) put it,\\nthe linguist’s “meaning” of a morpheme. . . is by deﬁnition the set of conditional\\nprobabilities of its occurrence in context with all other morphemes.\\nThe idea that the meaning of a word might be modeled as a point in a multi-\\ndimensional semantic space came from psychologists like Charles E. Osgood, who\\nhad been studying how people responded to the meaning of words by assigning val-\\nues along scales like happy/sad or hard/soft. Osgood et al. (1957) proposed that the\\nmeaning of a word in general could be modeled as a point in a multidimensional\\nEuclidean space, and that the similarity of meaning between two words could be\\nmodeled as the distance between these points in the space.\\nA ﬁnal intellectual source in the 1950s and early 1960s was the ﬁeld then called\\nmechanical indexing, now known asinformation retrieval. In what became knownmechanical\\nindexing\\nas the vector space model for information retrieval (Salton 1971, Sparck Jones\\n1986), researchers demonstrated new ways to deﬁne the meaning of words in terms\\nof vectors (Switzer, 1965), and reﬁned methods for word similarity based on mea-\\nsures of statistical association between words like mutual information (Giuliano,\\n1965) and idf (Sparck Jones, 1972), and showed that the meaning of documents\\ncould be represented in the same vector spaces used for words. Around the same\\ntime, (Cordier, 1965) showed that factor analysis of word association probabilities\\ncould be used to form dense vector representations of words.\\nSome of the philosophical underpinning of the distributional way of thinking\\ncame from the late writings of the philosopher Wittgenstein, who was skeptical of\\nthe possibility of building a completely formal theory of meaning deﬁnitions for\\neach word. Wittgenstein suggested instead that “the meaning of a word is its use in\\nthe language” (Wittgenstein, 1953, PI 43). That is, instead of using some logical lan-\\nguage to deﬁne each word, or drawing on denotations or truth values, Wittgenstein’s'),\n",

By the middle of the 20th century, beginning with the work of\\nHjelmslev (Hjelmslev, 1969) (originally 1943) and ﬂeshed out in early models of\\ngenerative grammar (Katz and Fodor, 1963), the idea arose of representing mean-\\ning with semantic features, symbols that represent some sort of primitive meaning.semantic\\nfeature\\nFor example words like hen, rooster, or chick, have something in common (they all\\ndescribe chickens) and something different (their age and sex), representable as:\\nhen +female, +chicken, +adult\\nrooster -female, +chicken, +adult\\nchick +chicken, -adult\\nThe dimensions used by vector models of meaning to deﬁne words, however, are\\nonly abstractly related to this idea of a small ﬁxed number of hand-built dimensions.\\nNonetheless, there has been some attempt to show that certain dimensions of em-\\nbedding models do contribute some speciﬁc compositional aspect of meaning like\\nthese early semantic features.\\nThe use of dense vectors to model word meaning, and indeed the term embed-\\nding, grew out of the latent semantic indexing (LSI) model (Deerwester et al.,\\n1988) recast as LSA (latent semantic analysis) (Deerwester et al., 1990). In LSA\\nsingular value decomposition— SVD— is applied to a term-document matrix (eachSVD\\ncell weighted by log frequency and normalized by entropy), and then the ﬁrst 300\\ndimensions are used as the LSA embedding. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\\nis a method for ﬁnding the most important dimensions of a data set, those dimen-\\nsions along which the data varies the most. LSA was then quickly widely applied:\\nas a cognitive model (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), and for tasks like spell checking\\n(Jones and Martin, 1997), language modeling (Bellegarda 1997, Coccaro and Ju-\\nrafsky 1998, Bellegarda 2000), morphology induction (Schone and Jurafsky 2000,\\nSchone and Jurafsky 2001b), multiword expressions (MWEs) (Schone and Jurafsky,\\n2001a), and essay grading (Rehder et al., 1998). Related models were simultane-\\nously developed and applied to word sense disambiguation by Sch¨utze (1992). LSA\\nalso led to the earliest use of embeddings to represent words in a probabilistic clas-\\nsiﬁer, in the logistic regression document router of Sch¨utze et al. (1995). The idea of\\nSVD on the term-term matrix (rather than the term-document matrix) as a model of\\nmeaning for NLP was proposed soon after LSA by Sch¨utze (1992). Sch ¨utze applied\\nthe low-rank (97-dimensional) embeddings produced by SVD to the task of word\\nsense disambiguation, analyzed the resulting semantic space, and also suggested\\npossible techniques like dropping high-order dimensions. See Sch ¨utze (1997).\\nA number of alternative matrix models followed on from the early SVD work,\\nincluding Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) (Hofmann, 1999), Latent\\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), and Non-negative Matrix Factoriza-\\ntion (NMF) (Lee and Seung, 1999).\\nThe LSA community seems to have ﬁrst used the word “embedding” in Landauer\\net al. (1997), in a variant of its mathematical meaning as a mapping from one space\\nor mathematical structure to another. In LSA, the word embedding seems to have\\ndescribed the mapping from the space of sparse count vectors to the latent space of\\nSVD dense vectors. Although the word thus originally meant the mapping from one'),\n",

Introduction\\nDespite the immense success of neural networks over the\\npast decade, the black-box nature of their predictions pre-\\nvent their wider and more reliable adoption in many indus-\\ntries, such as health and security. This fact led researchers to\\ninvestigate ways to explain neural network decisions. The\\nefforts in explaining neural network decisions can be cate-\\ngorized into several approaches: saliency maps, approxima-\\ntion by interpretable methods and joint models.\\nSaliency maps are ways of highlighting areas on the in-\\nput, of which a neural network make use of the most while\\nprediction. An earlier work [20] takes the gradient of the\\nneural network output with respect to the input in order to\\nvisualize an input-speciﬁc linearization of the entire net-\\nwork. Another work [26] uses a deconvnet to go back to\\nfeatures from decisions. The saliency maps obtained via\\nthese methods are often noisy and prevent a clear under-\\nstanding of the decisions made. Another track of meth-\\nods [29], [18], [4], [6] make use of the derivative of a neural\\nnetwork output with respect to an activation, usually the one\\nright before fully connected layers. This saliency maps ob-\\ntained by this track, and some other works [27], [11], [5] are\\nclearer in the sense of highlighting areas related to the pre-\\ndicted class. Although useful for purposes such as check-\\ning whether the support area for decisions are sound, these\\nmethods still lack a detailed logical reasoning of why such\\ndecision is made.\\nConversion between neural networks and interpretable\\nby-design models -such as decision trees- has been a topic\\nof interest. In [8], a method was devised to initialize neural\\nnetworks with decision trees. [9, 19, 25] also provides neu-\\nral network equivalents of decision trees. The neural net-\\nworks in these works have speciﬁc architectures, thus the\\nconversion lacks generalization to any model. In [24], neu-\\nral networks were trained in such a way that their decision\\nboundaries can be approximated by trees. This work does\\nnot provide a correspondence between neural networks and\\ndecision trees, and merely uses the latter as a regulariza-\\ntion. In [7], a neural network was used to train a decision\\ntree. Such tree distillation is an approximation of a neural\\nnetwork and not a direct conversion, thus performs poorly\\non the tasks that the neural network was trained on.\\nJoint neural network and decision tree models [12], [16],\\n[13], [14], [17], [2], [10], [22] genarally use deep learning to\\nassists some trees, or come up with a neural network struc-\\nture so it resembles a tree. A recent work [23] replaces the\\nﬁnal fully connected layer of a neural network with a deci-\\nsion tree. Since the backbone features are still that of neural\\nnetworks, the explanation is sought to be achieved via pro-\\nviding a means to humans to validate the decision as a good\\nor bad one, rather than a complete logical reasoning of the\\ndecision.\\nIn this paper, we show that any neural network having\\nany activations has a directly equivalent decision tree rep-\\nresentation. Thus, the induced tree output is exactly the\\nsame with that of the neural network and tree representation\\ndoesn’t limit or require altering of the neural architecture\\nin any way. We believe that the decision tree equivalence\\nprovides better understanding of neural networks and paves\\nthe way to tackle the black-box nature of neural networks,\\ne.g. via analyzing the category that a test sample belongs\\nto, which can be extracted by the node rules that a sample\\nis categorized.

We extend the\\nﬁndings in these works to any activation function and also\\nrecurrent neural networks.\\n2. Decision Tree Analysis of Neural Networks\\nThe derivations in this section will be ﬁrst made for feed-\\nforward neural networks with piece-wise linear activation\\nfunctions such as ReLU, Leaky ReLU, etc. Next, the analy-\\nsis will be extended to any neural network with any activa-\\ntion function.\\n2.1. Fully Connected Networks\\nLet Wi be the weight matrix of a network’s ith layer.\\nLet σ be any piece-wise linear activation function, and x0\\nbe the input to the neural network. Then, the output and an\\nintermediate feature of a feed-forward neural network can\\nbe represented as in Eq. 1.\\nNN(x0) =WT\\nn−1σ(WT\\nn−2σ(...WT\\n1 σ(WT\\n0 x0)))\\nxi = σ(WT\\ni−1σ(...WT\\n1 σ(WT\\n0 x0)))\\n(1)\\nNote that in Eq. 1, we omit any ﬁnal activation (e.g.\\nsoftmax) and we ignore the bias term as it can be simply\\nincluded by concatenating a 1 value to each xi. The acti-\\nvation function σacts as an element-wise scalar multiplica-\\ntion, hence the following can be written.\\nWT\\ni σ(WT\\ni−1xi−1) =WT\\ni (ai−1 ⊙(WT\\ni−1xi−1)) (2)\\nIn Eq. 2, ai−1 is a vector indicating the slopes of activa-\\ntions in the corresponding linear regions where WT\\ni−1xi−1\\nfall into, ⊙denotes element-wise multiplication. Note that,\\nai−1 can directly be interpreted as a categorization result\\nsince it includes indicators (slopes) of linear regions in ac-\\ntivation function. The Eq. 2 can be re-organized as follows.\\nWT\\ni σ(WT\\ni−1xi−1) = (Wi ⊙ai−1)T WT\\ni−1xi−1 (3)\\nIn Eq. 3, we use ⊙as a column-wise element-wise\\nmultiplication on Wi. This corresponds to element-wise\\nmultiplication by a matrix obtained via by repeating ai−1\\ncolumn-vector to match the size of Wi. Using Eq. 3, Eq. 1\\ncan be rewritten as follows.\\nNN(x0) = (Wn−1 ⊙an−2)T (Wn−2 ⊙an−3)T\\n...(W1 ⊙a0)T WT\\n0 x0\\n(4)\\nFrom Eq. 4, one can deﬁne an effective weight matrix\\nˆW\\nT\\ni of a layerito be applied directly on inputx0 as follows:\\nCi−1\\nˆW\\nT\\ni = (Wi ⊙ai−1)T ...(W1 ⊙a0)T WT\\n0\\nCi−1\\nˆW\\nT\\ni x0 = WT\\ni xi\\n(5)\\nIn Eq. 5, the categorization vector until layer i is de-\\nﬁned as follows: ci−1 = a0 ∥a1 ∥...ai−1, where ∥ is the\\nconcatenation operator.\\nOne can directly observe from Eq. 5 that, the effec-\\ntive matrix of layer i is only dependent on the categoriza-\\ntion vectors from previous layers. This indicates that in\\neach layer, a new efﬁcient ﬁlter is selected -to be applied\\non the network input- based on the previous categoriza-\\ntions/decisions. This directly shows that a fully connected\\nneural network can be represented as a single decision tree,\\nwhere effective matrices acts as categorization rules. In\\neach layer i, response of effective matrixCi−1\\nˆW\\nT\\ni is catego-\\nrized into ai vector, and based on this categorization result,\\nnext layer’s effective matrixCi\\nˆW\\nT\\ni+1 is determined. A layer\\niis thus represented askmi -way categorization, wheremi is\\nthe number ﬁlters in each layer iand kis the total number\\nof linear regions in an activation. This categorization in a\\nlayer ican thus be represented by a tree of depth mi, where\\na node in any depth is branched into kcategorizations.\\nIn order to better illustrate the equivalent decision tree of\\na neural network, in Algorithm 1, we rewrite Eq. 5 for the\\nentire network, as an algorithm. For the sake of simplic-\\nity and without loss of generality, we provide the algorithm\\nwith the ReLU activation function, where a ∈ {0,1}. It\\ncan be clearly observed that, the lines 5 −9 in Algorithm 1\\ncorresponds to a node in the decision tree, where a simple\\nyes/no decision is made.\\nThe decision tree equivalent of a neural network can thus\\nbe constructed as in Algorithm 2. Using this algorithm,\\nwe share a a tree representation obtained for a neural net-\\nwork with three layers, having 2,1 and 1 ﬁlter for layer 1,\\n2 and 3 respectively. The network has ReLU activation in\\nbetween layers, and no activation after last layer. It can be\\nobserved from Algorithm 2 and Fig. 1 that the depth of a\\nNN-equivalent tree is d = ∑n−2\\ni=0 mi, and total number of\\ncategories in last branch is 2d. At ﬁrst glance, the number\\nof categories seem huge. For example, if ﬁrst layer of a neu-\\nral network contains 64 ﬁlters, there would exist at least264\\nbranches in a tree, which is already intractable. But, there'),\n",

Convolutional Neural Networks\\nLet Ki : Ci+1 ×Ci ×Mi ×Ni be the convolution kernel\\nfor layer i, applying on an input Fi : Ci ×Hi ×Wi. Note\\nthat Mi and Ni denote the spatial size of the convolutional\\nkernel, and Hi and Wi denote the spatial size of the input.\\nOne can write the output of a convolutional neural net-\\nwork CNN(F0), and an intermediate feature Fi as follows.\\nCNN(F0) =Kn−1 ∗σ(Kn−2 ∗σ(...σ(K0 ∗F0))\\nFi = σ(Ki−1 ∗σ(...σ(K0 ∗F0)) (9)\\nSimilar to the fully connected network analysis, one can\\nwrite the following, due to element-wise scalar multiplica-\\ntion nature of the activation function.\\nKi ∗σ(Ki−1 ∗Fi−1) = (Ki ⊙ai−1) ∗(Ki−1 ∗Fi−1) (10)\\nIn Eq. 10, ai−1 is of same spatial size as Ki and consists\\nof the slopes of activation function in corresponding regions\\nin the previous feature Fi−1. Note that the above only holds\\nfor a speciﬁc spatial region, and there exists a separate ai−1\\nfor each spatial region that the convolution Ki−1 is applied\\nto. For example, if Ki−1 is a 3 ×3 kernel, there exists a\\nseparate ai−1 for all 3 ×3 regions that the convolution is\\napplied to. An effective convolution Ci−1\\nˆKi can be written\\nas follows.\\nci−1\\nˆKi = (Ki ⊙ai−1) ∗...∗(K1 ⊙a0) ∗K0\\nci−1\\nˆKi ∗x0 = Ki ∗xi\\n(11)\\nNote that in Eq. 11, Ci−1\\nˆKi contains speciﬁc effective\\nconvolutions per region, where a region is deﬁned accord-\\ning to the receptive ﬁeld of layer i. c is deﬁned as the con-\\ncatenated categorization results of all relevant regions from\\nprevious layers.\\nOne can observe from Eq. 11 that effecive convolu-\\ntions are only dependent on categorizations coming from\\nactivations, which enables the tree equivalence -similar to\\nthe analysis for fully connected network. A difference from\\nfully connected layer case is that many decisions are made\\non partial input regions rather than entire x0.\\n2.3. Continuous Activation Functions\\nIn Eq. 2, for piece-wise linear activations, elements of a\\ncan have a number of values limited by the piece-wise lin-\\near regions in the activation function. This number deﬁnes\\nthe number of child nodes per effective ﬁlter. The exten-\\nsion to continuous activation functions is trivial as they can\\nbe considered as piece-wise linear functions with inﬁnite\\nregions. Therefore, for continuous activations, the neural\\nnetwork equivalent tree immediately becomes inﬁnite width\\neven for a single ﬁlter. This might not be a useful result, but\\nwe provide this discussion here for completeness. In order\\nto guarantee ﬁnite trees, one may consider using quantized\\nversions of continuous activations which may result in a few\\npiece-wise linear regions, hence few child nodes per activa-\\ntion.\\n2.4. Recurrent Networks\\nAs recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be unrolled to\\nfeed-forward representation, RNNs can also be equivalently\\nrepresented as decision trees.

Experimental Results\\nFirst, we make a toy experiment where we ﬁt a neural\\nnetwork to: y = x2 equation. The neural network has 3\\ndense layers with 2 ﬁlters each, except for last layer which\\nhas 1 ﬁlter. The network uses leaky-ReLU activations after\\nfully connected layers, except for the last layer which has\\nno post-activation. We have used negative slope of 0.3 for\\nleaky-ReLU which is the default value in Tensorﬂow [1].\\nThe network was trained with5000 (x,y) pairs where xwas\\nregularly sampled from [−2.5,2.5] interval. Fig. 2 shows\\nthe decision tree corresponding to the neural network. In the\\ntree, every black rectangle box indicates a rule, left child\\nfrom the box means the rule does not hold, and the right\\nchild means the rule holds. For better visualization, the\\nrules are obtained via converting wT x+ β > 0 to direct\\ninequalities acting on x. This can be done for the partic-\\nular regression y = x2, since x is a scalar. In every leaf,\\nthe network applies a linear function -indicated by a red\\nrectangle- based on the decisions so far. We have avoided\\nwriting these functions explicitly due to limited space. At\\nﬁrst glance, the tree representation of a neural network in\\nthis example seems large due to the 2\\n∑n−2\\ni mi = 24 = 16\\ncategorizations. However, we notice that a lot of the rules\\nin the decision tree is redundant, and hence some paths in\\nthe decision tree becomes invalid. An example to redundant\\nrule is checking x< 0.32 after x< −1.16 rule holds. This'),\n",

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time.

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices Kand V. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations.

Traditional object detection\\nmethods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable\\narchitectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing\\ncomplex ensembles which combine multiple low-level image\\nfeatures with high-level context from object detectors and scene\\nclassiﬁers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more\\npowerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level,\\ndeeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing\\nin traditional architectures. These models behave differently\\nin network architecture, training strategy and optimization\\nfunction, etc. In this paper, we provide a review on deep\\nlearning based object detection frameworks. Our review begins\\nwith a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and\\nits representative tool, namely Convolutional Neural Network\\n(CNN). Then we focus on typical generic object detection\\narchitectures along with some modiﬁcations and useful tricks\\nto improve detection performance further. As distinct speciﬁc\\ndetection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also brieﬂy\\nsurvey several speciﬁc tasks, including salient object detection,\\nface detection and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses\\nare also provided to compare various methods and draw some\\nmeaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and\\ntasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in\\nboth object detection and relevant neural network based learning\\nsystems.\\nIndex Terms—deep learning, object detection, neural network\\nI. I NTRODUCTION\\nT\\nO gain a complete image understanding, we should not\\nonly concentrate on classifying different images, but\\nalso try to precisely estimate the concepts and locations of\\nobjects contained in each image. This task is referred as object\\ndetection [1][S1], which usually consists of different subtasks\\nsuch as face detection [2][S2], pedestrian detection [3][S2]\\nand skeleton detection [4][S3]. As one of the fundamental\\ncomputer vision problems, object detection is able to provide\\nvaluable information for semantic understanding of images\\nand videos, and is related to many applications, including\\nimage classiﬁcation [5], [6], human behavior analysis [7][S4],\\nface recognition [8][S5] and autonomous driving [9], [10].\\nMeanwhile, Inheriting from neural networks and related learn-\\ning systems, the progress in these ﬁelds will develop neural\\nnetwork algorithms, and will also have great impacts on object\\ndetection techniques which can be considered as learning\\nsystems. [11]–[14][S6]. However, due to large variations in\\nviewpoints, poses, occlusions and lighting conditions, it’s difﬁ-\\ncult to perfectly accomplish object detection with an additional\\nZhong-Qiu Zhao, Peng Zheng and Shou-Tao Xu are with the College of\\nComputer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technol-\\nogy, China.

So much attention has been attracted\\nto this ﬁeld in recent years [15]–[18].\\nThe problem deﬁnition of object detection is to determine\\nwhere objects are located in a given image (object localization)\\nand which category each object belongs to (object classiﬁca-\\ntion). So the pipeline of traditional object detection models\\ncan be mainly divided into three stages: informative region\\nselection, feature extraction and classiﬁcation.\\nInformative region selection. As different objects may appear\\nin any positions of the image and have different aspect ratios\\nor sizes, it is a natural choice to scan the whole image with a\\nmulti-scale sliding window. Although this exhaustive strategy\\ncan ﬁnd out all possible positions of the objects, its short-\\ncomings are also obvious. Due to a large number of candidate\\nwindows, it is computationally expensive and produces too\\nmany redundant windows. However, if only a ﬁxed number of\\nsliding window templates are applied, unsatisfactory regions\\nmay be produced.\\nFeature extraction. To recognize different objects, we need\\nto extract visual features which can provide a semantic and\\nrobust representation. SIFT [19], HOG [20] and Haar-like [21]\\nfeatures are the representative ones. This is due to the fact\\nthat these features can produce representations associated with\\ncomplex cells in human brain [19]. However, due to the diver-\\nsity of appearances, illumination conditions and backgrounds,\\nit’s difﬁcult to manually design a robust feature descriptor to\\nperfectly describe all kinds of objects.\\nClassiﬁcation. Besides, a classiﬁer is needed to distinguish\\na target object from all the other categories and to make the\\nrepresentations more hierarchical, semantic and informative\\nfor visual recognition. Usually, the Supported Vector Machine\\n(SVM) [22], AdaBoost [23] and Deformable Part-based Model\\n(DPM) [24] are good choices. Among these classiﬁers, the\\nDPM is a ﬂexible model by combining object parts with\\ndeformation cost to handle severe deformations. In DPM, with\\nthe aid of a graphical model, carefully designed low-level\\nfeatures and kinematically inspired part decompositions are\\ncombined. And discriminative learning of graphical models\\nallows for building high-precision part-based models for a\\nvariety of object classes.\\nBased on these discriminant local feature descriptors and\\nshallow learnable architectures, state of the art results have\\nbeen obtained on PASCAL VOC object detection competition\\n[25] and real-time embedded systems have been obtained with\\na low burden on hardware. However, small gains are obtained\\nduring 2010-2012 by only building ensemble systems and\\nemploying minor variants of successful methods [15]. This fact\\nis due to the following reasons: 1) The generation of candidate\\nbounding boxes with a sliding window strategy is redundant,\\ninefﬁcient and inaccurate. 2) The semantic gap cannot be\\narXiv:1807.05511v2  [cs.CV]  16 Apr 2019'),\n",

They have deeper architectures with the\\ncapacity to learn more complex features than the shallow ones.\\nAlso the expressivity and robust training algorithms allow to\\nlearn informative object representations without the need to\\ndesign features manually [26].\\nSince the proposal of R-CNN, a great deal of improved\\nmodels have been suggested, including Fast R-CNN which\\njointly optimizes classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\ntasks [16], Faster R-CNN which takes an additional sub-\\nnetwork to generate region proposals [18] and YOLO which\\naccomplishes object detection via a ﬁxed-grid regression [17].\\nAll of them bring different degrees of detection performance\\nimprovements over the primary R-CNN and make real-time\\nand accurate object detection become more achievable.\\nIn this paper, a systematic review is provided to summarise\\nrepresentative models and their different characteristics in\\nseveral application domains, including generic object detec-\\ntion [15], [16], [18], salient object detection [27], [28], face\\ndetection [29]–[31] and pedestrian detection [32], [33]. Their\\nrelationships are depicted in Figure 1.

Therefore,\\ndifferent deep models are required by various images.\\nThere has been a relevant pioneer effort [34] which mainly\\nfocuses on relevant software tools to implement deep learning\\ntechniques for image classiﬁcation and object detection, but\\npays little attention on detailing speciﬁc algorithms. Different\\nfrom it, our work not only reviews deep learning based object\\ndetection models and algorithms covering different applica-\\ntion domains in detail, but also provides their corresponding\\nexperimental comparisons and meaningful analyses.\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section\\n2, a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and the\\nbasic architecture of CNN is provided. Generic object detec-\\ntion architectures are presented in Section 3. Then reviews\\nof CNN applied in several speciﬁc tasks, including salient\\nobject detection, face detection and pedestrian detection, are\\nexhibited in Section 4-6, respectively. Several promising future\\ndirections are proposed in Section 7. At last, some concluding\\nremarks are presented in Section 8.\\nII. A B RIEF OVERVIEW OF DEEP LEARNING\\nPrior to overview on deep learning based object detection\\napproaches, we provide a review on the history of deep\\nlearning along with an introduction on the basic architecture\\nand advantages of CNN.\\nA. The History: Birth, Decline and Prosperity\\nDeep models can be referred to as neural networks with\\ndeep structures. The history of neural networks can date back\\nto 1940s [35], and the original intention was to simulate the\\nhuman brain system to solve general learning problems in a\\nprincipled way. It was popular in 1980s and 1990s with the\\nproposal of back-propagation algorithm by Hinton et al. [36].\\nHowever, due to the overﬁtting of training, lack of large scale\\ntraining data, limited computation power and insigniﬁcance\\nin performance compared with other machine learning tools,\\nneural networks fell out of fashion in early 2000s.\\nDeep learning has become popular since 2006 [37][S7] with\\na break through in speech recognition [38]. The recovery of\\ndeep learning can be attributed to the following factors.\\n•The emergence of large scale annotated training data, such\\nas ImageNet [39], to fully exhibit its very large learning\\ncapacity;\\n•Fast development of high performance parallel computing\\nsystems, such as GPU clusters;\\n•Signiﬁcant advances in the design of network structures\\nand training strategies. With unsupervised and layerwise\\npre-training guided by Auto-Encoder (AE) [40] or Re-\\nstricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [41], a good initializa-\\ntion is provided. With dropout and data augmentation, the\\noverﬁtting problem in training has been relieved [6], [42].\\nWith batch normalization (BN), the training of very deep\\nneural networks becomes quite efﬁcient [43]. Meanwhile,\\nvarious network structures, such as AlexNet [6], Overfeat\\n[44], GoogLeNet [45], VGG [46] and ResNet [47], have\\nbeen extensively studied to improve the performance.\\nWhat prompts deep learning to have a huge impact on the\\nentire academic community? It may owe to the contribution of\\nHinton’s group, whose continuous efforts have demonstrated\\nthat deep learning would bring a revolutionary breakthrough\\non grand challenges rather than just obvious improvements on\\nsmall datasets. Their success results from training a large CNN\\non 1.2 million labeled images together with a few techniques\\n[6] (e.g., ReLU operation [48] and ‘dropout’ regularization).\\nB.

Each layer of CNN is known as a\\nfeature map. The feature map of the input layer is a 3D matrix\\nof pixel intensities for different color channels (e.g. RGB). The\\nfeature map of any internal layer is an induced multi-channel\\nimage, whose ‘pixel’ can be viewed as a speciﬁc feature. Every\\nneuron is connected with a small portion of adjacent neurons\\nfrom the previous layer (receptive ﬁeld). Different types of\\ntransformations [6], [49], [50] can be conducted on feature\\nmaps, such as ﬁltering and pooling. Filtering (convolution)\\noperation convolutes a ﬁlter matrix (learned weights) with\\nthe values of a receptive ﬁeld of neurons and takes a non-\\nlinear function (such as sigmoid [51], ReLU) to obtain ﬁnal\\nresponses. Pooling operation, such as max pooling, average\\npooling, L2-pooling and local contrast normalization [52],\\nsummaries the responses of a receptive ﬁeld into one value\\nto produce more robust feature descriptions.\\nWith an interleave between convolution and pooling, an\\ninitial feature hierarchy is constructed, which can be ﬁne-tuned\\nin a supervised manner by adding several fully connected (FC)\\nlayers to adapt to different visual tasks. According to the tasks\\ninvolved, the ﬁnal layer with different activation functions [6]\\nis added to get a speciﬁc conditional probability for each\\noutput neuron. And the whole network can be optimized on\\nan objective function (e.g. mean squared error or cross-entropy\\nloss) via the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The\\ntypical VGG16 has totally 13 convolutional (conv) layers, 3\\nfully connected layers, 3 max-pooling layers and a softmax\\nclassiﬁcation layer. The conv feature maps are produced by\\nconvoluting 3*3 ﬁlter windows, and feature map resolutions\\nare reduced with 2 stride max-pooling layers. An arbitrary test\\nimage of the same size as training samples can be processed\\nwith the trained network. Re-scaling or cropping operations\\nmay be needed if different sizes are provided [6].\\nThe advantages of CNN against traditional methods can be\\nsummarised as follows.\\n•Hierarchical feature representation, which is the multi-\\nlevel representations from pixel to high-level semantic fea-\\ntures learned by a hierarchical multi-stage structure [15],\\n[53], can be learned from data automatically and hidden\\nfactors of input data can be disentangled through multi-level\\nnonlinear mappings.\\n• Compared with traditional shallow models, a deeper\\narchitecture provides an exponentially increased expressive\\ncapability.\\n• The architecture of CNN provides an opportunity to\\njointly optimize several related tasks together (e.g. Fast R-\\nCNN combines classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\ninto a multi-task leaning manner).\\n• Beneﬁtting from the large learning capacity of deep\\nCNNs, some classical computer vision challenges can be\\nrecast as high-dimensional data transform problems and\\nsolved from a different viewpoint.\\nDue to these advantages, CNN has been widely applied\\ninto many research ﬁelds, such as image super-resolution\\nreconstruction [54], [55], image classiﬁcation [5], [56], im-\\nage retrieval [57], [58], face recognition [8][S5], pedestrian\\ndetection [59]–[61] and video analysis [62], [63].\\nIII. G ENERIC OBJECT DETECTION\\nGeneric object detection aims at locating and classifying\\nexisting objects in any one image, and labeling them with\\nrectangular bounding boxes to show the conﬁdences of exis-\\ntence. The frameworks of generic object detection methods\\ncan mainly be categorized into two types (see Figure 2).\\nOne follows traditional object detection pipeline, generating\\nregion proposals at ﬁrst and then classifying each proposal into\\ndifferent object categories. The other regards object detection\\nas a regression or classiﬁcation problem, adopting a uniﬁed\\nframework to achieve ﬁnal results (categories and locations)\\ndirectly. The region proposal based methods mainly include\\nR-CNN [15], SPP-net [64], Fast R-CNN [16], Faster R-CNN\\n[18], R-FCN [65], FPN [66] and Mask R-CNN [67], some of\\nwhich are correlated with each other (e.g. SPP-net modiﬁes R-\\nCNN with a SPP layer). The regression /classiﬁcation based\\nmethods mainly includes MultiBox [68], AttentionNet [69],\\nG-CNN [70], YOLO [17], SSD [71], YOLOv2 [72], DSSD\\n[73] and DSOD [74]. The correlations between these two\\npipelines are bridged by the anchors introduced in Faster R-\\nCNN. Details of these methods are as follows.\\nA. Region Proposal Based Framework\\nThe region proposal based framework, a two-step process,\\nmatches the attentional mechanism of human brain to some\\nextent, which gives a coarse scan of the whole scenario ﬁrstly\\nand then focuses on regions of interest. Among the pre-related\\nworks [44], [75], [76], the most representative one is Overfeat\\n[44]. This model inserts CNN into sliding window method,\\nwhich predicts bounding boxes directly from locations of\\nthe topmost feature map after obtaining the conﬁdences of\\nunderlying object categories.\\n1) R-CNN: It is of signiﬁcance to improve the quality of\\ncandidate bounding boxes and to take a deep architecture to\\nextract high-level features. To solve these problems, R-CNN\\n[15] was proposed by Ross Girshick in 2014 and obtained a\\nmean average precision (mAP) of 53.3% with more than 30%\\nimprovement over the previous best result (DPM HSC [77]) on\\nPASCAL VOC 2012. Figure 3 shows the ﬂowchart of R-CNN,\\nwhich can be divided into three stages as follows.\\nRegion proposal generation. The R-CNN adopts selective\\nsearch [78] to generate about 2k region proposals for each\\nimage. The selective search method relies on simple bottom-up\\ngrouping and saliency cues to provide more accurate candidate\\nboxes of arbitrary sizes quickly and to reduce the searching\\nspace in object detection [24], [39].\\nCNN based deep feature extraction. In this stage, each\\nregion proposal is warped or cropped into a ﬁxed resolution\\nand the CNN module in [6] is utilized to extract a 4096-\\ndimensional feature as the ﬁnal representation. Due to large\\nlearning capacity, dominant expressive power and hierarchical\\nstructure of CNNs, a high-level, semantic and robust feature\\nrepresentation for each region proposal can be obtained.\\nClassiﬁcation and localization. With pre-trained category-\\nspeciﬁc linear SVMs for multiple classes, different region pro-\\nposals are scored on a set of positive regions and background\\n(negative) regions. The scored regions are then adjusted with'),\n",

The best-performing methods are complex en-\\nsemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level\\nimage features with high-level context. In this paper, we\\npropose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that im-\\nproves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30%\\nrelative to the previous best result on VOC 2012—achieving\\na mAP of 53.3%.

Since we combine region propos-\\nals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with\\nCNN features. We also present experiments that provide\\ninsight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hier-\\narchy of image features.

The last decade of progress on various\\nvisual recognition tasks has been based considerably on the\\nuse of SIFT [26] and HOG [7]. But if we look at perfor-\\nmance on the canonical visual recognition task, PASCAL\\nVOC object detection [12], it is generally acknowledged\\nthat progress has been slow during 2010-2012, with small\\ngains obtained by building ensemble systems and employ-\\ning minor variants of successful methods.\\nSIFT and HOG are blockwise orientation histograms,\\na representation we could associate roughly with complex\\ncells in V1, the ﬁrst cortical area in the primate visual path-\\nway. But we also know that recognition occurs several\\nstages downstream, which suggests that there might be hier-\\narchical, multi-stage processes for computing features that\\nare even more informative for visual recognition.\\nFukushima’s “neocognitron” [16], a biologically-\\n1.

Our system (1)\\ntakes an input image, (2) extracts around 2000 bottom-up region\\nproposals, (3) computes features for each proposal using a large\\nconvolutional neural network (CNN), and then (4) classiﬁes each\\nregion using class-speciﬁc linear SVMs. R-CNN achieves a mean\\naverage precision (mAP) of 53.7% on PASCAL VOC 2010. For\\ncomparison, [32] reports 35.1% mAP using the same region pro-\\nposals, but with a spatial pyramid and bag-of-visual-words ap-\\nproach. The popular deformable part models perform at 33.4%.\\ninspired hierarchical and shift-invariant model for pattern\\nrecognition, was an early attempt at just such a process.\\nThe neocognitron, however, lacked a supervised training al-\\ngorithm. LeCun et al. [23] provided the missing algorithm\\nby showing that stochastic gradient descent, via backprop-\\nagation, can train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a\\nclass of models that extend the neocognitron.\\nCNNs saw heavy use in the 1990s ( e.g., [24]), but then\\nfell out of fashion, particularly in computer vision, with the\\nrise of support vector machines. In 2012, Krizhevsky et al.\\n[22] rekindled interest in CNNs by showing substantially\\nhigher image classiﬁcation accuracy on the ImageNet Large\\nScale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) [9, 10].\\nTheir success resulted from training a large CNN on 1.2\\nmillion labeled images, together with a few twists on Le-\\nCun’s CNN (e.g., max(x, 0) rectifying non-linearities and\\n“dropout” regularization).\\nThe signiﬁcance of the ImageNet result was vigorously\\ndebated during the ILSVRC 2012 workshop. The central\\nissue can be distilled to the following: To what extent do\\nthe CNN classiﬁcation results on ImageNet generalize to\\nobject detection results on the PASCAL VOC Challenge?\\nWe answer this question decisively by bridging the\\nchasm between image classiﬁcation and object detection.\\nThis paper is the ﬁrst to show that a CNN can lead to dra-\\n1\\nFig. 3. The ﬂowchart of R-CNN [15], which consists of 3 stages: (1) extracts\\nbottom-up region proposals, (2) computes features for each proposal using a\\nCNN, and then (3) classiﬁes each region with class-speciﬁc linear SVMs.\\nbounding box regression and ﬁltered with a greedy non-\\nmaximum suppression (NMS) to produce ﬁnal bounding boxes\\nfor preserved object locations.\\nWhen there are scarce or insufﬁcient labeled data, pre-\\ntraining is usually conducted. Instead of unsupervised pre-\\ntraining [79], R-CNN ﬁrstly conducts supervised pre-training\\non ILSVRC, a very large auxiliary dataset, and then takes a\\ndomain-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning. This scheme has been adopted by\\nmost of subsequent approaches [16], [18].\\nIn spite of its improvements over traditional methods and\\nsigniﬁcance in bringing CNN into practical object detection,\\nthere are still some disadvantages.\\n•Due to the existence of FC layers, the CNN requires a\\nﬁxed-size (e.g., 227×227) input image, which directly leads\\nto the re-computation of the whole CNN for each evaluated\\nregion, taking a great deal of time in the testing period.\\n•Training of R-CNN is a multi-stage pipeline. At ﬁrst,\\na convolutional network (ConvNet) on object proposals is\\nﬁne-tuned. Then the softmax classiﬁer learned by ﬁne-\\ntuning is replaced by SVMs to ﬁt in with ConvNet features.\\nFinally, bounding-box regressors are trained.\\n• Training is expensive in space and time. Features are\\nextracted from different region proposals and stored on the\\ndisk. It will take a long time to process a relatively small\\ntraining set with very deep networks, such as VGG16. At the\\nsame time, the storage memory required by these features\\nshould also be a matter of concern.\\n•Although selective search can generate region proposals\\nwith relatively high recalls, the obtained region proposals\\nare still redundant and this procedure is time-consuming\\n(around 2 seconds to extract 2k region proposals).\\nTo solve these problems, many methods have been pro-\\nposed. GOP [80] takes a much faster geodesic based segmen-\\ntation to replace traditional graph cuts. MCG [81] searches\\ndifferent scales of the image for multiple hierarchical segmen-\\ntations and combinatorially groups different regions to produce\\nproposals. Instead of extracting visually distinct segments,\\nthe edge boxes method [82] adopts the idea that objects are\\nmore likely to exist in bounding boxes with fewer contours\\nstraggling their boundaries. Also some researches tried to\\nre-rank or reﬁne pre-extracted region proposals to remove\\nunnecessary ones and obtained a limited number of valuable\\nones, such as DeepBox [83] and SharpMask [84].\\nIn addition, there are some improvements to solve the\\nproblem of inaccurate localization. Zhang et al. [85] utilized\\na bayesian optimization based search algorithm to guide\\nthe regressions of different bounding boxes sequentially, and\\ntrained class-speciﬁc CNN classiﬁers with a structured loss\\nto penalize the localization inaccuracy explicitly. Saurabh\\nGupta et al. improved object detection for RGB-D images\\nwith semantically rich image and depth features [86], and\\nlearned a new geocentric embedding for depth images to\\nencode each pixel. The combination of object detectors and\\nsuperpixel classiﬁcation framework gains a promising result\\non semantic scene segmentation task. Ouyang et al. proposed\\na deformable deep CNN (DeepID-Net) [87] which introduces\\na novel deformation constrained pooling (def-pooling) layer\\nto impose geometric penalty on the deformation of various\\nobject parts and makes an ensemble of models with different\\nsettings. Lenc et al. [88] provided an analysis on the role\\nof proposal generation in CNN-based detectors and tried to\\nreplace this stage with a constant and trivial region generation\\nscheme. The goal is achieved by biasing sampling to match\\nthe statistics of the ground truth bounding boxes with K-means\\nclustering. However, more candidate boxes are required to\\nachieve comparable results to those of R-CNN.\\n2) SPP-net: FC layers must take a ﬁxed-size input. That’s\\nwhy R-CNN chooses to warp or crop each region proposal\\ninto the same size. However, the object may exist partly in\\nthe cropped region and unwanted geometric distortion may be\\nproduced due to the warping operation. These content losses or\\ndistortions will reduce recognition accuracy, especially when\\nthe scales of objects vary.\\nTo solve this problem, He et al. took the theory of spatial\\npyramid matching (SPM) [89], [90] into consideration and\\nproposed a novel CNN architecture named SPP-net [64]. SPM\\ntakes several ﬁner to coarser scales to partition the image into\\na number of divisions and aggregates quantized local features\\ninto mid-level representations.\\nThe architecture of SPP-net for object detection can be\\nfound in Figure 4. Different from R-CNN, SPP-net reuses\\nfeature maps of the 5-th conv layer (conv5) to project region'),\n",

R-CNN ﬁrst extracts about 2,000 candi-\\ndate windows from each image via selective search\\n[20]. Then the image region in each window is warped\\nto a ﬁxed size (227 ×227). A pre-trained deep network\\nis used to extract the feature of each window. A\\nbinary SVM classiﬁer is then trained on these features\\nfor detection. R-CNN generates results of compelling\\nquality and substantially outperforms previous meth-\\nods. However, because R-CNN repeatedly applies the\\ndeep convolutional network to about 2,000 windows\\nper image, it is time-consuming. Feature extraction is\\nthe major timing bottleneck in testing.\\nOur SPP-net can also be used for object detection.\\nWe extract the feature maps from the entire image\\nonly once (possibly at multiple scales). Then we ap-\\nply the spatial pyramid pooling on each candidate\\nwindow of the feature maps to pool a ﬁxed-length\\nrepresentation of this window (see Figure 5). Because\\nthe time-consuming convolutions are only applied\\nonce, our method can run orders of magnitude faster.\\nOur method extracts window-wise features from\\nregions of the feature maps, while R-CNN extracts\\ndirectly from image regions. In previous works, the\\nDeformable Part Model (DPM) [23] extracts features\\nfrom windows in HOG [24] feature maps, and the\\nSelective Search (SS) method [20] extracts from win-\\ndows in encoded SIFT feature maps. The Overfeat\\ndetection method [5] also extracts from windows of\\ndeep convolutional feature maps, but needs to pre-\\ndeﬁne the window size. On the contrary, our method\\nenables feature extraction in arbitrary windows from\\nthe deep convolutional feature maps.\\nspatial pyramid \\npooling layer\\nfeature maps of conv5\\nconvolutional layers\\nfixed-length representation\\ninput image\\nwindow\\n…...\\nfully-connected layers (fc6, fc7)\\nFigure 5: Pooling features from arbitrary windows\\non feature maps. The feature maps are computed\\nfrom the entire image. The pooling is performed in\\ncandidate windows.\\n4.1 Detection Algorithm\\nWe use the “fast” mode of selective search [20] to\\ngenerate about 2,000 candidate windows per image.\\nThen we resize the image such that min(w,h) = s,\\nand extract the feature maps from the entire image.\\nWe use the SPP-net model of ZF-5 (single-size trained)\\nfor the time being. In each candidate window, we use\\na 4-level spatial pyramid (1 ×1, 2×2, 3×3, 6×6, totally\\n50 bins) to pool the features. This generates a 12,800-\\nd (256 ×50) representation for each window. These\\nrepresentations are provided to the fully-connected\\nlayers of the network. Then we train a binary linear\\nSVM classiﬁer for each category on these features.\\nOur implementation of the SVM training follows\\n[20], [7]. We use the ground-truth windows to gen-\\nerate the positive samples. The negative samples are\\nthose overlapping a positive window by at most 30%\\n(measured by the intersection-over-union (IoU) ratio).\\nAny negative sample is removed if it overlaps another\\nnegative sample by more than 70%. We apply the stan-\\ndard hard negative mining [23] to train the SVM. This\\nstep is iterated once. It takes less than 1 hour to train\\nSVMs for all 20 categories. In testing, the classiﬁer\\nis used to score the candidate windows. Then we use\\nnon-maximum suppression [23] (threshold of 30%) on\\nthe scored windows.\\nOur method can be improved by multi-scale feature\\nextraction. We resize the image such that min(w,h) =\\ns ∈ S = {480,576,688,864,1200}, and compute the\\nfeature maps of conv 5 for each scale. One strategy of\\ncombining the features from these scales is to pool\\nthem channel-by-channel. But we empirically ﬁnd\\nthat another strategy provides better results. For each\\ncandidate window, we choose a single scale s ∈ S\\nsuch that the scaled candidate window has a number\\nof pixels closest to 224 ×224. Then we only use the\\nfeature maps extracted from this scale to compute\\nFig. 4. The architecture of SPP-net for object detection [64].\\nSPPnet also has notable drawbacks. Like R-CNN, train-\\ning is a multi-stage pipeline that involves extracting fea-\\ntures, ﬁne-tuning a network with log loss, training SVMs,\\nand ﬁnally ﬁtting bounding-box regressors. Features are\\nalso written to disk. But unlike R-CNN, the ﬁne-tuning al-\\ngorithm proposed in [\\n11] cannot update the convolutional\\nlayers that precede the spatial pyramid pooling. Unsurpris-\\ningly, this limitation (ﬁxed convolutional layers) limits the\\naccuracy of very deep networks.\\n1.2. Contributions\\nWe propose a new training algorithm that ﬁxes the disad-\\nvantages of R-CNN and SPPnet, while improving on their\\nspeed and accuracy. We call this method Fast R-CNN be-\\ncause it’s comparatively fast to train and test. The Fast R-\\nCNN method has several advantages:\\n1. Higher detection quality (mAP) than R-CNN, SPPnet\\n2. Training is single-stage, using a multi-task loss\\n3. Training can update all network layers\\n4. No disk storage is required for feature caching\\nFast R-CNN is written in Python and C++ (Caffe\\n[\\n13]) and is available under the open-source MIT Li-\\ncense at https://github.com/rbgirshick/\\nfast-rcnn.\\n2. Fast R-CNN architecture and training\\nFig. 1 illustrates the Fast R-CNN architecture. A Fast\\nR-CNN network takes as input an entire image and a set\\nof object proposals. The network ﬁrst processes the whole\\nimage with several convolutional ( conv) and max pooling\\nlayers to produce a conv feature map. Then, for each ob-\\nject proposal a region of interest ( RoI) pooling layer ex-\\ntracts a ﬁxed-length feature vector from the feature map.\\nEach feature vector is fed into a sequence of fully connected\\n(fc) layers that ﬁnally branch into two sibling output lay-\\ners: one that produces softmax probability estimates over\\nK object classes plus a catch-all “background” class and\\nanother layer that outputs four real-valued numbers for each\\nof the K object classes. Each set of 4 values encodes reﬁned\\nbounding-box positions for one of the K classes.\\n2.1. The RoI pooling layer\\nThe RoI pooling layer uses max pooling to convert the\\nfeatures inside any valid region of interest into a small fea-\\nture map with a ﬁxed spatial extent of H × W (e.g., 7 × 7),\\nwhere H and W are layer hyper-parameters that are inde-\\npendent of any particular RoI. In this paper, an RoI is a\\nrectangular window into a conv feature map. Each RoI is\\ndeﬁned by a four-tuple (r, c, h, w ) that speciﬁes its top-left\\ncorner (r, c) and its height and width (h, w ).\\nDeep\\nConvNet\\nConv\\nfeature map\\nRoI\\nprojection\\nRoI\\npooling\\nlayer\\nFCs\\nRoI feature\\nvector\\nsoftmax\\nbbox\\nregressor\\nOutputs:\\nFC FC\\nFor each RoI\\nFigure 1. Fast R-CNN architecture. An input image and multi-\\nple regions of interest (RoIs) are input into a fully convolutional\\nnetwork. Each RoI is pooled into a ﬁxed-size feature map and\\nthen mapped to a feature vector by fully connected layers (FCs).\\nThe network has two output vectors per RoI: softmax probabilities\\nand per-class bounding-box regression offsets. The architecture is\\ntrained end-to-end with a multi-task loss.\\nRoI max pooling works by dividing the h × w RoI win-\\ndow into an H × W grid of sub-windows of approximate\\nsize h/H × w/W and then max-pooling the values in each\\nsub-window into the corresponding output grid cell. Pool-\\ning is applied independently to each feature map channel,\\nas in standard max pooling. The RoI layer is simply the\\nspecial-case of the spatial pyramid pooling layer used in\\nSPPnets [\\n11] in which there is only one pyramid level. We\\nuse the pooling sub-window calculation given in [ 11].\\n2.2. Initializing from pre-trained networks\\nWe experiment with three pre-trained ImageNet [ 4] net-\\nworks, each with ﬁve max pooling layers and between ﬁve\\nand thirteen conv layers (see Section\\n4.1 for network de-\\ntails). When a pre-trained network initializes a Fast R-CNN\\nnetwork, it undergoes three transformations.\\nFirst, the last max pooling layer is replaced by a RoI\\npooling layer that is conﬁgured by setting H and W to be\\ncompatible with the net’s ﬁrst fully connected layer ( e.g.,\\nH = W = 7 for VGG16).\\nSecond, the network’s last fully connected layer and soft-\\nmax (which were trained for 1000-way ImageNet classiﬁ-\\ncation) are replaced with the two sibling layers described\\nearlier (a fully connected layer and softmax over K + 1 cat-\\negories and category-speciﬁc bounding-box regressors).\\nThird, the network is modiﬁed to take two data inputs: a\\nlist of images and a list of RoIs in those images.\\n2.3. Fine-tuning for detection\\nTraining all network weights with back-propagation is an\\nimportant capability of Fast R-CNN. First, let’s elucidate\\nwhy SPPnet is unable to update weights below the spatial\\npyramid pooling layer.\\nThe root cause is that back-propagation through the SPP\\nlayer is highly inefﬁcient when each training sample ( i.e.\\nRoI) comes from a different image, which is exactly how\\nR-CNN and SPPnet networks are trained. The inefﬁciency\\n1441\\nFig. 5. The architecture of Fast R-CNN [16].\\nproposals of arbitrary sizes to ﬁxed-length feature vectors. The\\nfeasibility of the reusability of these feature maps is due to\\nthe fact that the feature maps not only involve the strength of\\nlocal responses, but also have relationships with their spatial\\npositions [64]. The layer after the ﬁnal conv layer is referred\\nto as spatial pyramid pooling layer (SPP layer). If the number\\nof feature maps in conv5 is 256, taking a 3-level pyramid,\\nthe ﬁnal feature vector for each region proposal obtained after\\nSPP layer has a dimension of 256 ×(12 + 22 + 42) = 5376.\\nSPP-net not only gains better results with correct estimation\\nof different region proposals in their corresponding scales, but\\nalso improves detection efﬁciency in testing period with the\\nsharing of computation cost before SPP layer among different\\nproposals.\\n3) Fast R-CNN: Although SPP-net has achieved impressive\\nimprovements in both accuracy and efﬁciency over R-CNN,\\nit still has some notable drawbacks. SPP-net takes almost\\nthe same multi-stage pipeline as R-CNN, including feature\\nextraction, network ﬁne-tuning, SVM training and bounding-\\nbox regressor ﬁtting. So an additional expense on storage space\\nis still required. Additionally, the conv layers preceding the\\nSPP layer cannot be updated with the ﬁne-tuning algorithm\\nintroduced in [64]. As a result, an accuracy drop of very deep\\nnetworks is unsurprising. To this end, Girshick [16] introduced\\na multi-task loss on classiﬁcation and bounding box regression\\nand proposed a novel CNN architecture named Fast R-CNN.\\nThe architecture of Fast R-CNN is exhibited in Figure 5.\\nSimilar to SPP-net, the whole image is processed with conv\\nlayers to produce feature maps. Then, a ﬁxed-length feature\\nvector is extracted from each region proposal with a region of\\ninterest (RoI) pooling layer. The RoI pooling layer is a special\\ncase of the SPP layer, which has only one pyramid level. Each\\nfeature vector is then fed into a sequence of FC layers before\\nﬁnally branching into two sibling output layers. One output\\nlayer is responsible for producing softmax probabilities for\\nall C+ 1categories (C object classes plus one ‘background’\\nclass) and the other output layer encodes reﬁned bounding-\\nbox positions with four real-valued numbers. All parameters\\nin these procedures (except the generation of region proposals)\\nare optimized via a multi-task loss in an end-to-end way.\\nThe multi-tasks loss L is deﬁned as below to jointly train\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding-box regression,\\nL(p,u,t u,v) =Lcls(p,u) +λ[u≥1]Lloc(tu,v) (1)\\nwhere Lcls(p,u) =−log pu calculates the log loss for ground\\ntruth class u and pu is driven from the discrete probability\\ndistribution p= (p0,··· ,pC) over the C+1 outputs from the\\nlast FC layer. Lloc(tu,v) is deﬁned over the predicted offsets\\ntu = (tu\\nx,tu\\ny,tu\\nw,tu\\nh) and ground-truth bounding-box regression\\ntargets v = (vx,vy,vw,vh), where x,y,w,h denote the two\\ncoordinates of the box center, width, and height, respectively.\\nEach tu adopts the parameter settings in [15] to specify an\\nobject proposal with a log-space height/width shift and scale-\\ninvariant translation. The Iverson bracket indicator function\\n[u≥1] is employed to omit all background RoIs. To provide\\nmore robustness against outliers and eliminate the sensitivity\\nin exploding gradients, a smooth L1 loss is adopted to ﬁt\\nbounding-box regressors as below\\nLloc(tu,v) =\\n∑\\ni∈x,y,w,h\\nsmoothL1 (tu\\ni −vi) (2)\\nwhere\\nsmoothL1 (x) =\\n{\\n0.5x2 if|x|<1\\n|x|−0.5 otherwise (3)\\nTo accelerate the pipeline of Fast R-CNN, another two tricks\\nare of necessity. On one hand, if training samples (i.e. RoIs)\\ncome from different images, back-propagation through the\\nSPP layer becomes highly inefﬁcient. Fast R-CNN samples\\nmini-batches hierarchically, namely N images sampled ran-\\ndomly at ﬁrst and then R/N RoIs sampled in each image,\\nwhere R represents the number of RoIs. Critically, computa-\\ntion and memory are shared by RoIs from the same image in\\nthe forward and backward pass. On the other hand, much time\\nis spent in computing the FC layers during the forward pass\\n[16]. The truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [91]\\ncan be utilized to compress large FC layers and to accelerate\\nthe testing procedure.\\nIn the Fast R-CNN, regardless of region proposal genera-\\ntion, the training of all network layers can be processed in\\na single-stage with a multi-task loss. It saves the additional\\nexpense on storage space, and improves both accuracy and\\nefﬁciency with more reasonable training schemes.\\n4) Faster R-CNN: Despite the attempt to generate candi-\\ndate boxes with biased sampling [88], state-of-the-art object\\ndetection networks mainly rely on additional methods, such as\\nselective search and Edgebox, to generate a candidate pool of\\nisolated region proposals. Region proposal computation is also\\na bottleneck in improving efﬁciency. To solve this problem,\\nRen et al. introduced an additional Region Proposal Network\\n(RPN) [18], [92], which acts in a nearly cost-free way by\\nsharing full-image conv features with detection network.\\nRPN is achieved with a fully-convolutional network, which\\nhas the ability to predict object bounds and scores at each\\nposition simultaneously. Similar to [78], RPN takes an image\\nof arbitrary size to generate a set of rectangular object propos-\\nals. RPN operates on a speciﬁc conv layer with the preceding\\nlayers shared with object detection network.'),\n",

Each sliding window is mapped to a lower-dimensional vector (256-d for ZF and 512-d\\nfor VGG). This vector is fed into two sibling fully-connected layers—a box-regression layer ( reg)\\nand a box-classiﬁcation layer ( cls). We use n = 3in this paper, noting that the effective receptive\\nﬁeld on the input image is large (171 and 228 pixels for ZF and VGG, respectively). This mini-\\nnetwork is illustrated at a single position in Fig. 1 (left). Note that because the mini-network operates\\nin a sliding-window fashion, the fully-connected layers are shared across all spatial locations. This\\narchitecture is naturally implemented with an n×nconv layer followed by two sibling 1 ×1 conv\\nlayers (for reg and cls, respectively). ReLUs [15] are applied to the output of the n×nconv layer.\\nTranslation-Invariant Anchors\\nAt each sliding-window location, we simultaneously predict k region proposals, so the reg layer\\nhas 4k outputs encoding the coordinates of k boxes. The cls layer outputs 2k scores that estimate\\nprobability of object / not-object for each proposal. 2 The kproposals are parameterized relative to\\nkreference boxes, called anchors. Each anchor is centered at the sliding window in question, and is\\nassociated with a scale and aspect ratio. We use 3 scales and 3 aspect ratios, yieldingk= 9anchors\\nat each sliding position. For a conv feature map of a sizeW×H(typically ∼2,400), there are WHk\\nanchors in total. An important property of our approach is that it is translation invariant, both in\\nterms of the anchors and the functions that compute proposals relative to the anchors.\\nAs a comparison, the MultiBox method [20] uses k-means to generate 800 anchors, which are not\\ntranslation invariant. If one translates an object in an image, the proposal should translate and the\\nsame function should be able to predict the proposal in either location. Moreover, because the\\nMultiBox anchors are not translation invariant, it requires a (4+1) ×800-dimensional output layer,\\nwhereas our method requires a (4+2)×9-dimensional output layer. Our proposal layers have an order\\nof magnitude fewer parameters (27 million for MultiBox using GoogLeNet [20] vs. 2.4 million for\\nRPN using VGG-16), and thus have less risk of overﬁtting on small datasets, like PASCAL VOC.\\nA Loss Function for Learning Region Proposals\\nFor training RPNs, we assign a binary class label (of being an object or not) to each anchor. We\\nassign a positive label to two kinds of anchors: (i) the anchor/anchors with the highest Intersection-\\nover-Union (IoU) overlap with a ground-truth box, or (ii) an anchor that has an IoU overlap higher\\nthan 0.7 with any ground-truth box. Note that a single ground-truth box may assign positive labels\\nto multiple anchors. We assign a negative label to a non-positive anchor if its IoU ratio is lower than\\n0.3 for all ground-truth boxes. Anchors that are neither positive nor negative do not contribute to the\\ntraining objective.\\nWith these deﬁnitions, we minimize an objective function following the multi-task loss in Fast R-\\nCNN [5].

These\\ntwo terms are normalized with the mini-batch size ( Ncls)\\nand the number of anchor locations ( Nreg), respectively.

Introduction\\nRecognizing objects at vastly different scales is a fun-\\ndamental challenge in computer vision. Feature pyramids\\nbuilt upon image pyramids (for short we call these featur-\\nized image pyramids) form the basis of a standard solution\\n[1] (Fig. 1(a)). These pyramids are scale-invariant in the\\nsense that an object’s scale change is offset by shifting its\\nlevel in the pyramid. Intuitively, this property enables a\\nmodel to detect objects across a large range of scales by\\nscanning the model over both positions and pyramid levels.\\nFeaturized image pyramids were heavily used in the\\nera of hand-engineered features [5, 25]. They were so\\ncritical that object detectors like DPM [7] required dense\\nscale sampling to achieve good results ( e.g., 10 scales per\\noctave).

Aside from being\\ncapable of representing higher-level semantics, ConvNets\\nare also more robust to variance in scale and thus facilitate\\nrecognition from features computed on a single input scale\\n[15, 11, 29] (Fig. 1(b)). But even with this robustness, pyra-\\nmids are still needed to get the most accurate results. All re-\\ncent top entries in the ImageNet [33] and COCO [21] detec-\\ntion challenges use multi-scale testing on featurized image\\npyramids (e.g., [16, 35]). The principle advantage of fea-\\nturizing each level of an image pyramid is that it produces\\na multi-scale feature representation in which all levels are\\nsemantically strong, including the high-resolution levels.\\nNevertheless, featurizing each level of an image pyra-\\nmid has obvious limitations. Inference time increases con-\\nsiderably (e.g., by four times [11]), making this approach\\nimpractical for real applications.

However, it turns out to be\\ninferior with such a naive solution [47]. This inconsistence is\\ndue to the dilemma of respecting translation variance in object\\ndetection compared with increasing translation invariance in\\nimage classiﬁcation. In other words, shifting an object inside\\nan image should be indiscriminative in image classiﬁcation\\nwhile any translation of an object in a bounding box may\\nbe meaningful in object detection. A manual insertion of\\nthe RoI pooling layer into convolutions can break down\\ntranslation invariance at the expense of additional unshared\\nregion-wise layers. So Li et al. [65] proposed a region-based\\nfully convolutional networks (R-FCN, Fig. S2).\\nDifferent from Faster R-CNN, for each category, the last\\nconv layer of R-FCN produces a total of k2 position-sensitive\\nscore maps with a ﬁxed grid of k×k ﬁrstly and a position-\\nsensitive RoI pooling layer is then appended to aggregate the\\nresponses from these score maps. Finally, in each RoI, k2\\nposition-sensitive scores are averaged to produce a C + 1-d\\nvector and softmax responses across categories are computed.\\nAnother 4k2-d conv layer is appended to obtain class-agnostic\\nbounding boxes.\\nWith R-FCN, more powerful classiﬁcation networks can be\\nadopted to accomplish object detection in a fully-convolutional\\narchitecture by sharing nearly all the layers, and state-of-the-\\nart results are obtained on both PASCAL VOC and Microsoft\\nCOCO [94] datasets at a test speed of 170ms per image.\\n6) FPN: Feature pyramids built upon image pyramids\\n(featurized image pyramids) have been widely applied in\\nmany object detection systems to improve scale invariance\\n[24], [64] (Figure 7(a)). However, training time and memory\\nconsumption increase rapidly. To this end, some techniques\\ntake only a single input scale to represent high-level semantics\\nand increase the robustness to scale changes (Figure 7(b)),\\nand image pyramids are built at test time which results in\\nan inconsistency between train/test-time inferences [16], [18].\\nThe in-network feature hierarchy in a deep ConvNet produces\\nfeature maps of different spatial resolutions while introduces\\nlarge semantic gaps caused by different depths (Figure 7(c)).\\nTo avoid using low-level features, pioneer works [71], [95]\\nusually build the pyramid starting from middle layers or\\njust sum transformed feature responses, missing the higher-'),\n",

The Mask R-CNN framework for instance segmentation [67].\\nresolution maps of the feature hierarchy.\\nDifferent from these approaches, FPN [66] holds an ar-\\nchitecture with a bottom-up pathway, a top-down pathway\\nand several lateral connections to combine low-resolution and\\nsemantically strong features with high-resolution and seman-\\ntically weak features (Figure 7(d)). The bottom-up pathway,\\nwhich is the basic forward backbone ConvNet, produces a\\nfeature hierarchy by downsampling the corresponding feature\\nmaps with a stride of 2. The layers owning the same size of\\noutput maps are grouped into the same network stage and the\\noutput of the last layer of each stage is chosen as the reference\\nset of feature maps to build the following top-down pathway.\\nTo build the top-down pathway, feature maps from higher\\nnetwork stages are upsampled at ﬁrst and then enhanced with\\nthose of the same spatial size from the bottom-up pathway\\nvia lateral connections. A 1 ×1 conv layer is appended to\\nthe upsampled map to reduce channel dimensions and the\\nmergence is achieved by element-wise addition. Finally, a3×3\\nconvolution is also appended to each merged map to reduce\\nthe aliasing effect of upsampling and the ﬁnal feature map is\\ngenerated. This process is iterated until the ﬁnest resolution\\nmap is generated.\\nAs feature pyramid can extract rich semantics from all\\nlevels and be trained end-to-end with all scales, state-of-the-\\nart representation can be obtained without sacriﬁcing speed\\nand memory. Meanwhile, FPN is independent of the backbone\\nCNN architectures and can be applied to different stages of\\nobject detection (e.g. region proposal generation) and to many\\nother computer vision tasks (e.g. instance segmentation).\\n7) Mask R-CNN: Instance segmentation [96] is a challeng-\\ning task which requires detecting all objects in an image and\\nsegmenting each instance (semantic segmentation [97]). These\\ntwo tasks are usually regarded as two independent processes.\\nAnd the multi-task scheme will create spurious edge and\\nexhibit systematic errors on overlapping instances [98]. To\\nsolve this problem, parallel to the existing branches in Faster\\nR-CNN for classiﬁcation and bounding box regression, the\\nMask R-CNN [67] adds a branch to predict segmentation\\nmasks in a pixel-to-pixel manner (Figure 8).\\nDifferent from the other two branches which are inevitably\\ncollapsed into short output vectors by FC layers, the segmen-\\ntation mask branch encodes an m×m mask to maintain the\\nexplicit object spatial layout. This kind of fully convolutional\\nrepresentation requires fewer parameters but is more accurate\\nthan that of [97]. Formally, besides the two losses in (1) for\\nclassiﬁcation and bounding box regression, an additional loss\\nfor segmentation mask branch is deﬁned to reach a multi-task\\nloss. An this loss is only associated with ground-truth class\\nand relies on the classiﬁcation branch to predict the category.\\nBecause RoI pooling, the core operation in Faster R-CNN,\\nperforms a coarse spatial quantization for feature extraction,\\nmisalignment is introduced between the RoI and the features.\\nIt affects classiﬁcation little because of its robustness to small\\ntranslations. However, it has a large negative effect on pixel-\\nto-pixel mask prediction. To solve this problem, Mask R-CNN\\nadopts a simple and quantization-free layer, namely RoIAlign,\\nto preserve the explicit per-pixel spatial correspondence faith-\\nfully. RoIAlign is achieved by replacing the harsh quantization\\nof RoI pooling with bilinear interpolation [99], computing the\\nexact values of the input features at four regularly sampled\\nlocations in each RoI bin. In spite of its simplicity, this\\nseemingly minor change improves mask accuracy greatly,\\nespecially under strict localization metrics.\\nGiven the Faster R-CNN framework, the mask branch only\\nadds a small computational burden and its cooperation with\\nother tasks provides complementary information for object\\ndetection. As a result, Mask R-CNN is simple to implement\\nwith promising instance segmentation and object detection\\nresults. In a word, Mask R-CNN is a ﬂexible and efﬁcient\\nframework for instance-level recognition, which can be easily\\ngeneralized to other tasks (e.g. human pose estimation [7][S4])\\nwith minimal modiﬁcation.\\n8) Multi-task Learning, Multi-scale Representation and\\nContextual Modelling: Although the Faster R-CNN gets\\npromising results with several hundred proposals, it still strug-\\ngles in small-size object detection and localization, mainly due\\nto the coarseness of its feature maps and limited information\\nprovided in particular candidate boxes. The phenomenon is\\nmore obvious on the Microsoft COCO dataset which consists\\nof objects at a broad range of scales, less prototypical images,\\nand requires more precise localization. To tackle these prob-\\nlems, it is of necessity to accomplish object detection with\\nmulti-task learning [100], multi-scale representation [95] and\\ncontext modelling [101] to combine complementary informa-\\ntion from multiple sources.\\nMulti-task Learning learns a useful representation for\\nmultiple correlated tasks from the same input [102], [103].\\nBrahmbhatt et al. introduced conv features trained for ob-\\nject segmentation and ‘stuff’ (amorphous categories such as\\nground and water) to guide accurate object detection of small\\nobjects (StuffNet) [100].

To address this problem,\\nShrivastava et al. proposed an effective online mining algo-\\nrithm (OHEM) [113] for automatic selection of the hard ex-\\namples, which leads to a more effective and efﬁcient training.\\nInstead of concentrating on feature extraction, Ren et al.\\nmade a detailed analysis on object classiﬁers [114], and\\nfound that it is of particular importance for object detection\\nto construct a deep and convolutional per-region classiﬁer\\ncarefully, especially for ResNets [47] and GoogLeNets [45].\\nTraditional CNN framework for object detection is not\\nskilled in handling signiﬁcant scale variation, occlusion or\\ntruncation, especially when only 2D object detection is in-\\nvolved. To address this problem, Xiang et al. proposed a\\nnovel subcategory-aware region proposal network [60], which\\nguides the generation of region proposals with subcategory\\ninformation related to object poses and jointly optimize object\\ndetection and subcategory classiﬁcation.\\nOuyang et al. found that the samples from different classes\\nfollow a longtailed distribution [115], which indicates that dif-\\nferent classes with distinct numbers of samples have different\\ndegrees of impacts on feature learning. To this end, objects are\\nﬁrstly clustered into visually similar class groups, and then a\\nhierarchical feature learning scheme is adopted to learn deep\\nrepresentations for each group separately.\\nIn order to minimize computational cost and achieve the\\nstate-of-the-art performance, with the ‘deep and thin’ design\\nprinciple and following the pipeline of Fast R-CNN, Hong et\\nal. proposed the architecture of PV ANET [116], which adopts\\nsome building blocks including concatenated ReLU [117],\\nInception [45], and HyperNet [101] to reduce the expense on\\nmulti-scale feature extraction and trains the network with batch\\nnormalization [43], residual connections [47], and learning\\nrate scheduling based on plateau detection [47]. The PV ANET\\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance and can be processed\\nin real time on Titan X GPU (21 FPS).\\nB. Regression /Classiﬁcation Based Framework\\nRegion proposal based frameworks are composed of sev-\\neral correlated stages, including region proposal generation,\\nfeature extraction with CNN, classiﬁcation and bounding box\\nregression, which are usually trained separately. Even in recent\\nend-to-end module Faster R-CNN, an alternative training is\\nstill required to obtain shared convolution parameters between\\nRPN and detection network. As a result, the time spent in\\nhandling different components becomes the bottleneck in real-\\ntime application.\\nOne-step frameworks based on global regres-\\nsion/classiﬁcation, mapping straightly from image pixels\\nto bounding box coordinates and class probabilities, can\\nreduce time expense. We ﬁrstly reviews some pioneer CNN\\nmodels, and then focus on two signiﬁcant frameworks,\\nnamely You only look once (YOLO) [17] and Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71].\\n1) Pioneer Works: Previous to YOLO and SSD, many\\nresearchers have already tried to model object detection as\\na regression or classiﬁcation task.\\nSzegedy et al. formulated object detection task as a DNN-\\nbased regression [118], generating a binary mask for the\\ntest image and extracting detections with a simple bounding\\nbox inference. However, the model has difﬁculty in handling\\noverlapping objects, and bounding boxes generated by direct\\nupsampling is far from perfect.\\nPinheiro et al. proposed a CNN model with two branches:\\none generates class agnostic segmentation masks and the\\nother predicts the likelihood of a given patch centered on\\nan object [119]. Inference is efﬁcient since class scores and\\nsegmentation can be obtained in a single model with most of\\nthe CNN operations shared.\\nErhan et al. proposed regression based MultiBox to produce\\nscored class-agnostic region proposals [68], [120]. A uniﬁed\\nloss was introduced to bias both localization and conﬁdences\\nof multiple components to predict the coordinates of class-\\nagnostic bounding boxes. However, a large quantity of addi-\\ntional parameters are introduced to the ﬁnal layer.\\nYoo et al. adopted an iterative classiﬁcation approach to\\nhandle object detection and proposed an impressive end-to-\\nend CNN architecture named AttentionNet [69]. Starting from\\nthe top-left (TL) and bottom-right (BR) corner of an image,\\nAttentionNet points to a target object by generating quantized\\nweak directions and converges to an accurate object bound-\\nary box with an ensemble of iterative predictions. However,\\nthe model becomes quite inefﬁcient when handling multiple\\ncategories with a progressive two-step procedure.\\nNajibi et al. proposed a proposal-free iterative grid based\\nobject detector (G-CNN), which models object detection as'),\n",

Starting with a ﬁxed multi-scale bounding box\\ngrid, G-CNN trains a regressor to move and scale elements of\\nthe grid towards objects iteratively. However, G-CNN has a\\ndifﬁculty in dealing with small or highly overlapping objects.\\n2) YOLO: Redmon et al. [17] proposed a novel framework\\ncalled YOLO, which makes use of the whole topmost feature\\nmap to predict both conﬁdences for multiple categories and\\nbounding boxes. The basic idea of YOLO is exhibited in\\nFigure 9. YOLO divides the input image into an S×S grid and\\neach grid cell is responsible for predicting the object centered\\nin that grid cell. Each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes\\nand their corresponding conﬁdence scores. Formally, conﬁ-\\ndence scores are deﬁned as Pr(Object) ∗IOUtruth\\npred , which\\nindicates how likely there exist objects ( Pr(Object) ≥0) and\\nshows conﬁdences of its prediction ( IOUtruth\\npred ). At the same\\ntime, regardless of the number of boxes, C conditional class\\nprobabilities (Pr(Classi|Object)) should also be predicted in\\neach grid cell. It should be noticed that only the contribution\\nfrom the grid cell containing an object is calculated.\\nAt test time, class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each box\\nare achieved by multiplying the individual box conﬁdence\\npredictions with the conditional class probabilities as follows.\\nPr(Object) ∗IOUtruth\\npred ∗Pr(Classi|Object)\\n= Pr(Classi) ∗IOUtruth\\npred\\n(5)\\nwhere the existing probability of class-speciﬁc objects in the\\nbox and the ﬁtness between the predicted box and the object\\nare both taken into consideration.\\nDuring training, the following loss function is optimized,\\nλcoord\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 obj\\nij\\n[\\n(xi −ˆxi)2 + (yi −ˆyi)2]\\n+λcoord\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 obj\\nij\\n[(√wi −\\n√\\nˆwi)2 + (\\n√\\nhi −\\n√\\nˆhi\\n)2]\\n+\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 obj\\nij\\n(\\nCi −ˆCi\\n)2\\n+λnoobj\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\nB∑\\nj=0\\n1 noobj\\nij\\n(\\nCi −ˆCi\\n)2\\n+\\nS2\\n∑\\ni=0\\n1 obj\\ni\\n∑\\nc∈classes\\n(pi(c) −ˆpi(c))2\\n(6)\\nIn a certain cell i, (xi,yi) denote the center of the box relative\\nto the bounds of the grid cell,(wi,hi) are the normalized width\\nand height relative to the image size, Ci represents conﬁdence\\nscores, 1 obj\\ni indicates the existence of objects and 1 obj\\nij denotes\\nthat the prediction is conducted by the jth bounding box\\npredictor. Note that only when an object is present in that grid\\ncell, the loss function penalizes classiﬁcation errors. Similarly,\\nwhen the predictor is ‘responsible’ for the ground truth box\\n(i.e. the highest IoU of any predictor in that grid cell is\\nachieved), bounding box coordinate errors are penalized.\\nThe YOLO consists of 24 conv layers and 2 FC layers,\\nof which some conv layers construct ensembles of inception\\nmodules with 1 ×1 reduction layers followed by 3 ×3 conv\\nlayers. The network can process images in real-time at 45\\nFPS and a simpliﬁed version Fast YOLO can reach 155 FPS\\nwith better results than other real-time detectors. Furthermore,\\nYOLO produces fewer false positives on background, which\\nmakes the cooperation with Fast R-CNN become possible. An\\nimproved version, YOLOv2, was later proposed in [72], which\\nadopts several impressive strategies, such as BN, anchor boxes,\\ndimension cluster and multi-scale training.\\n3) SSD: YOLO has a difﬁculty in dealing with small\\nobjects in groups, which is caused by strong spatial constraints\\nimposed on bounding box predictions [17]. Meanwhile, YOLO\\nstruggles to generalize to objects in new/unusual aspect ratios/\\nconﬁgurations and produces relatively coarse features due to\\nmultiple downsampling operations.\\nAiming at these problems, Liu et al. proposed a Single Shot\\nMultiBox Detector (SSD) [71], which was inspired by the\\nanchors adopted in MultiBox [68], RPN [18] and multi-scale\\nrepresentation [95]. Given a speciﬁc feature map, instead of\\nﬁxed grids adopted in YOLO, the SSD takes advantage of a set\\nof default anchor boxes with different aspect ratios and scales\\nto discretize the output space of bounding boxes. To handle\\nobjects with various sizes, the network fuses predictions from\\nmultiple feature maps with different resolutions .\\nThe architecture of SSD is demonstrated in Figure 10. Given\\nthe VGG16 backbone architecture, SSD adds several feature\\nlayers to the end of the network, which are responsible for\\npredicting the offsets to default boxes with different scales and\\naspect ratios and their associated conﬁdences. The network is\\ntrained with a weighted sum of localization loss (e.g. Smooth\\nL1) and conﬁdence loss (e.g. Softmax), which is similar to\\n(1). Final detection results are obtained by conducting NMS\\non multi-scale reﬁned bounding boxes.\\nIntegrating with hard negative mining, data augmentation\\nand a larger number of carefully chosen default anchors,\\nSSD signiﬁcantly outperforms the Faster R-CNN in terms of\\naccuracy on PASCAL VOC and COCO, while being three\\ntimes faster. The SSD300 (input image size is 300×300) runs\\nat 59 FPS, which is more accurate and efﬁcient than YOLO.\\nHowever, SSD is not skilled at dealing with small objects,\\nwhich can be relieved by adopting better feature extractor\\nbackbone (e.g. ResNet101), adding deconvolution layers with\\nskip connections to introduce additional large-scale context\\n[73] and designing better network structure (e.g. Stem Block\\nand Dense Block) [74].'),\n",

The\\nevaluated approaches include R-CNN [15], SPP-net [64], Fast\\nR-CNN [16], NOC [114], Bayes [85], MR-CNN &S-CNN\\n[105], Faster R-CNN [18], HyperNet [101], ION [95], MS-\\nGR [104], StuffNet [100], SSD300 [71], SSD512 [71], OHEM\\n[113], SDP+CRC [33], GCNN [70], SubCNN [60], GBD-Net\\n[109], PV ANET [116], YOLO [17], YOLOv2 [72], R-FCN\\n[65], FPN [66], Mask R-CNN [67], DSSD [73] and DSOD\\n[74]. If no speciﬁc instructions for the adopted framework\\nare provided, the utilized model is a VGG16 [46] pretrained\\non 1000-way ImageNet classiﬁcation task [39]. Due to the\\nlimitation of paper length, we only provide an overview, in-\\ncluding proposal, learning method, loss function, programming\\nlanguage and platform, of the prominent architectures in Table\\nI. Detailed experimental settings, which can be found in the\\noriginal papers, are missed. In addition to the comparisons of\\ndetection accuracy, another comparison is provided to evaluate\\ntheir test consumption on PASCAL VOC 2007.\\n1) PASCAL VOC 2007/2012: PASCAL VOC 2007 and\\n2012 datasets consist of 20 categories. The evaluation terms\\nare Average Precision (AP) in each single category and mean\\nAverage Precision (mAP) across all the 20 categories. Com-\\nparative results are exhibited in Table II and III, from which\\nthe following remarks can be obtained.\\n•If incorporated with a proper way, more powerful back-\\nbone CNN models can deﬁnitely improve object detection\\nperformance (the comparison among R-CNN with AlexNet,\\nR-CNN with VGG16 and SPP-net with ZF-Net [122]).\\n• With the introduction of SPP layer (SPP-net), end-to-\\nend multi-task architecture (FRCN) and RPN (Faster R-\\nCNN), object detection performance is improved gradually\\nand apparently.\\n•Due to large quantities of trainable parameters, in order to\\nobtain multi-level robust features, data augmentation is very\\nimportant for deep learning based models (Faster R-CNN\\nwith ‘07’ ,‘07+12’ and ‘07+12+coco’).\\n•Apart from basic models, there are still many other factors\\naffecting object detection performance, such as multi-scale\\nand multi-region feature extraction (e.g. MR-CNN), modi-\\nﬁed classiﬁcation networks (e.g. NOC), additional informa-\\ntion from other correlated tasks (e.g. StuffNet, HyperNet),\\nmulti-scale representation (e.g. ION) and mining of hard\\nnegative samples (e.g. OHEM).\\n•As YOLO is not skilled in producing object localizations\\nof high IoU, it obtains a very poor result on VOC 2012.\\nHowever, with the complementary information from Fast\\nR-CNN (YOLO+FRCN) and the aid of other strategies,\\nsuch as anchor boxes, BN and ﬁne grained features, the\\nlocalization errors are corrected (YOLOv2).\\n•By combining many recent tricks and modelling the whole\\nnetwork as a fully convolutional one, R-FCN achieves a\\nmore obvious improvement of detection performance over\\nother approaches.\\n2) Microsoft COCO: Microsoft COCO is composed of\\n300,000 fully segmented images, in which each image has\\nan average of 7 object instances from a total of 80 categories.\\nAs there are a lot of less iconic objects with a broad range\\nof scales and a stricter requirement on object localization,\\nthis dataset is more challenging than PASCAL 2012. Object\\ndetection performance is evaluated by AP computed under\\ndifferent degrees of IoUs and on different object sizes. The\\nresults are shown in Table IV.\\nBesides similar remarks to those of PASCAL VOC, some\\nother conclusions can be drawn as follows from Table IV.\\n• Multi-scale training and test are beneﬁcial in improv-\\ning object detection performance, which provide additional\\ninformation in different resolutions (R-FCN). FPN and\\nDSSD provide some better ways to build feature pyramids\\nto achieve multi-scale representation. The complementary\\ninformation from other related tasks is also helpful for\\naccurate object localization (Mask R-CNN with instance\\nsegmentation task).\\n• Overall, region proposal based methods, such as\\nFaster R-CNN and R-FCN, perform better than regres-\\nsion/classﬁcation based approaches, namely YOLO and\\nSSD, due to the fact that quite a lot of localization errors\\nare produced by regression/classﬁcation based approaches.\\n• Context modelling is helpful to locate small objects,\\nwhich provides additional information by consulting nearby\\nobjects and surroundings (GBD-Net and multi-path).\\n•Due to the existence of a large number of nonstandard\\nsmall objects, the results on this dataset are much worse\\nthan those of VOC 2007/2012. With the introduction of\\nother powerful frameworks (e.g. ResNeXt [123]) and useful\\nstrategies (e.g. multi-task learning [67], [124]), the perfor-\\nmance can be improved.\\n•The success of DSOD in training from scratch stresses the\\nimportance of network design to release the requirements\\nfor perfect pre-trained classiﬁers on relevant tasks and large\\nnumbers of annotated samples.\\n3) Timing Analysis: Timing analysis (Table V) is conducted\\non Intel i7-6700K CPU with a single core and NVIDIA Titan'),\n",

S ALIENT OBJECT DETECTION\\nVisual saliency detection, one of the most important and\\nchallenging tasks in computer vision, aims to highlight the\\nmost dominant object regions in an image. Numerous ap-\\nplications incorporate the visual saliency to improve their\\nperformance, such as image cropping [125] and segmentation\\n[126], image retrieval [57] and object detection [66].\\nBroadly, there are two branches of approaches in salient\\nobject detection, namely bottom-up (BU) [127] and top-down\\n(TD) [128]. Local feature contrast plays the central role in BU\\nsalient object detection, regardless of the semantic contents of\\nthe scene. To learn local feature contrast, various local and\\nglobal features are extracted from pixels, e.g. edges [129],\\nspatial information [130]. However, high-level and multi-scale\\nsemantic information cannot be explored with these low-level\\nfeatures. As a result, low contrast salient maps instead of\\nsalient objects are obtained. TD salient object detection is task-\\noriented and takes prior knowledge about object categories\\nto guide the generation of salient maps. Taking semantic\\nsegmentation as an example, a saliency map is generated in the\\nsegmentation to assign pixels to particular object categories via\\na TD approach [131]. In a word, TD saliency can be viewed\\nas a focus-of-attention mechanism, which prunes BU salient\\npoints that are unlikely to be parts of the object [132].\\nA. Deep learning in Salient Object Detection\\nDue to the signiﬁcance for providing high-level and multi-\\nscale feature representation and the successful applications\\nin many correlated computer vision tasks, such as semantic\\nsegmentation [131], edge detection [133] and generic object\\ndetection [16], it is feasible and necessary to extend CNN to\\nsalient object detection.\\nThe early work by Eleonora Vig et al. [28] follows a\\ncompletely automatic data-driven approach to perform a large-\\nscale search for optimal features, namely an ensemble of deep\\nnetworks with different layers and parameters. To address the\\nproblem of limited training data, Kummerer et al. proposed the\\nDeep Gaze [134] by transferring from the AlexNet to generate\\na high dimensional feature space and create a saliency map. A\\nsimilar architecture was proposed by Huang et al. to integrate\\nsaliency prediction into pre-trained object recognition DNNs\\n[135]. The transfer is accomplished by ﬁne-tuning DNNs’\\nweights with an objective function based on the saliency\\nevaluation metrics, such as Similarity, KL-Divergence and\\nNormalized Scanpath Saliency.\\nSome works combined local and global visual clues to\\nimprove salient object detection performance. Wang et al.\\ntrained two independent deep CNNs (DNN-L and DNN-G)\\nto capture local information and global contrast and predicted\\nsaliency maps by integrating both local estimation and global\\nsearch [136]. Cholakkal et al. proposed a weakly supervised\\nsaliency detection framework to combine visual saliency from\\nbottom-up and top-down saliency maps, and reﬁned the results\\nwith a multi-scale superpixel-averaging [137]. Zhao et al.\\nproposed a multi-context deep learning framework, which\\nutilizes a uniﬁed learning framework to model global and\\nlocal context jointly with the aid of superpixel segmentation\\n[138]. To predict saliency in videos, Bak et al. fused two\\nstatic saliency models, namely spatial stream net and tem-\\nporal stream net, into a two-stream framework with a novel\\nempirically grounded data augmentation technique [139].\\nComplementary information from semantic segmentation\\nand context modeling is beneﬁcial. To learn internal represen-\\ntations of saliency efﬁciently, He et al. proposed a novel su-\\nperpixelwise CNN approach called SuperCNN [140], in which\\nsalient object detection is formulated as a binary labeling\\nproblem. Based on a fully convolutional neural network, Li\\net al. proposed a multi-task deep saliency model, in which\\nintrinsic correlations between saliency detection and semantic\\nsegmentation are set up [141]. However, due to the conv layers\\nwith large receptive ﬁelds and pooling layers, blurry object\\nboundaries and coarse saliency maps are produced. Tang et\\nal. proposed a novel saliency detection framework (CRPSD)\\n[142], which combines region-level saliency estimation and\\npixel-level saliency prediction together with three closely\\nrelated CNNs. Li et al. proposed a deep contrast network\\nto combine segment-wise spatial pooling and pixel-level fully\\nconvolutional streams [143].\\nThe proper integration of multi-scale feature maps is also\\nof signiﬁcance for improving detection performance. Based\\non Fast R-CNN, Wang et al. proposed the RegionNet by\\nperforming salient object detection with end-to-end edge pre-\\nserving and multi-scale contextual modelling [144]. Liu et al.\\n[27] proposed a multi-resolution convolutional neural network\\n(Mr-CNN) to predict eye ﬁxations, which is achieved by\\nlearning both bottom-up visual saliency and top-down visual\\nfactors from raw image data simultaneously. Cornia et al.\\nproposed an architecture which combines features extracted at\\ndifferent levels of the CNN [145]. Li et al. proposed a multi-\\nscale deep CNN framework to extract three scales of deep\\ncontrast features [146], namely the mean-subtracted region,\\nthe bounding box of its immediate neighboring regions and\\nthe masked entire image, from each candidate region.\\nIt is efﬁcient and accurate to train a direct pixel-wise\\nCNN architecture to predict salient objects with the aids of\\nRNNs and deconvolution networks. Pan et al. formulated\\nsaliency prediction as a minimization optimization on the\\nEuclidean distance between the predicted saliency map and\\nthe ground truth and proposed two kinds of architectures\\n[147]: a shallow one trained from scratch and a deeper one\\nadapted from deconvoluted VGG network. As convolutional-\\ndeconvolution networks are not expert in recognizing objects\\nof multiple scales, Kuen et al. proposed a recurrent attentional\\nconvolutional-deconvolution network (RACDNN) with several\\nspatial transformer and recurrent network units to conquer\\nthis problem [148]. To fuse local, global and contextual\\ninformation of salient objects, Tang et al. developed a deeply-\\nsupervised recurrent convolutional neural network (DSRCNN)\\nto perform a full image-to-image saliency detection [149].'),\n",

Experimental Evaluation\\nFour representative datasets, including ECSSD [156], HKU-\\nIS [146], PASCALS [157], and SOD [158], are used to\\nevaluate several state-of-the-art methods. ECSSD consists of\\n1000 structurally complex but semantically meaningful natural\\nimages. HKU-IS is a large-scale dataset containing over 4000\\nchallenging images. Most of these images have more than\\none salient object and own low contrast. PASCALS is a\\nsubset chosen from the validation set of PASCAL VOC 2010\\nsegmentation dataset and is composed of 850 natural images.\\nThe SOD dataset possesses 300 images containing multiple\\nsalient objects. The training and validation sets for different\\ndatasets are kept the same as those in [152].\\nTwo standard metrics, namely F-measure and the mean\\nabsolute error (MAE), are utilized to evaluate the quality of a\\nsaliency map. Given precision and recall values pre-computed\\non the union of generated binary mask B and ground truth Z,\\nF-measure is deﬁned as below\\nFβ = (1 +β2)Presion ×Recall\\nβ2Presion + Recall (7)\\nwhere β2 is set to 0.3 in order to stress the importance of the\\nprecision value.\\nThe MAE score is computed with the following equation\\nMAE = 1\\nH×W\\nH∑\\ni=1\\nW∑\\nj=1\\n⏐⏐⏐ˆS(i,j) = ˆZ(i,j)\\n⏐⏐⏐ (8)\\nwhere ˆZ and ˆS represent the ground truth and the continuous\\nsaliency map, respectively. W and H are the width and\\nheight of the salient area, respectively. This score stresses\\nthe importance of successfully detected salient objects over\\ndetected non-salient pixels [159].\\nThe following approaches are evaluated: CHM [150], RC\\n[151], DRFI [152], MC [138], MDF [146], LEGS [136], DSR\\n[149], MTDNN [141], CRPSD [142], DCL [143], ELD [153],\\nNLDF [154] and DSSC [155]. Among these methods, CHM,\\nRC and DRFI are classical ones with the best performance\\n[159], while the other methods are all associated with CNN.\\nF-measure and MAE scores are shown in Table VI.\\nFrom Table VI, we can ﬁnd that CNN based methods\\nperform better than classic methods. MC and MDF combine\\nthe information from local and global context to reach a\\nmore accurate saliency. ELD refers to low-level handcrafted\\nfeatures for complementary information. LEGS adopts generic\\nregion proposals to provide initial salient regions, which may\\nbe insufﬁcient for salient detection. DSR and MT act in\\ndifferent ways by introducing recurrent network and semantic\\nsegmentation, which provide insights for future improvements.\\nCPRSD, DCL, NLDF and DSSC are all based on multi-scale\\nrepresentations and superpixel segmentation, which provide\\nrobust salient regions and smooth boundaries. DCL, NLDF\\nand DSSC perform the best on these four datasets. DSSC\\nearns the best performance by modelling scale-to-scale short-\\nconnections.\\nOverall, as CNN mainly provides salient information in\\nlocal regions, most of CNN based methods need to model\\nvisual saliency along region boundaries with the aid of su-\\nperpixel segmentation. Meanwhile, the extraction of multi-\\nscale deep CNN features is of signiﬁcance for measuring local\\nconspicuity. Finally, it’s necessary to strengthen local con-\\nnections between different CNN layers and as well to utilize\\ncomplementary information from local and global context.\\nV. F ACE DETECTION\\nFace detection is essential to many face applications and acts\\nas an important pre-processing procedure to face recognition\\n[160]–[162], face synthesis [163], [164] and facial expression\\nanalysis [165]. Different from generic object detection, this\\ntask is to recognize and locate face regions covering a very\\nlarge range of scales (30-300 pts vs. 10-1000 pts). At the same\\ntime, faces have their unique object structural conﬁgurations\\n(e.g. the distribution of different face parts) and characteristics\\n(e.g. skin color). All these differences lead to special attention\\nto this task. However, large visual variations of faces, such as\\nocclusions, pose variations and illumination changes, impose\\ngreat challenges for this task in real applications.\\nThe most famous face detector proposed by Viola and\\nJones [166] trains cascaded classiﬁers with Haar-Like features\\nand AdaBoost, achieving good performance with real-time\\nefﬁciency. However, this detector may degrade signiﬁcantly\\nin real-world applications due to larger visual variations of\\nhuman faces. Different from this cascade structure, Felzen-\\nszwalb et al. proposed a deformable part model (DPM) for face\\ndetection [24]. However, for these traditional face detection\\nmethods, high computational expenses and large quantities\\nof annotations are required to achieve a reasonable result.\\nBesides, their performance is greatly restricted by manually\\ndesigned features and shallow architecture.\\nA. Deep learning in Face Detection\\nRecently, some CNN based face detection approaches have\\nbeen proposed [167]–[169].As less accurate localization re-\\nsults from independent regressions of object coordinates, Yu\\net al. [167] proposed a novel IoU loss function for predicting\\nthe four bounds of box jointly. Farfade et al. [168] proposed a\\nDeep Dense Face Detector (DDFD) to conduct multi-view face\\ndetection, which is able to detect faces in a wide range of ori-\\nentations without requirement of pose/landmark annotations.\\nYang et al. proposed a novel deep learning based face detection\\nframework [169], which collects the responses from local fa-\\ncial parts (e.g. eyes, nose and mouths) to address face detection\\nunder severe occlusions and unconstrained pose variations.\\nYang et al. [170] proposed a scale-friendly detection network\\nnamed ScaleFace, which splits a large range of target scales\\ninto smaller sub-ranges. Different specialized sub-networks are\\nconstructed on these sub-scales and combined into a single\\none to conduct end-to-end optimization. Hao et al. designed an\\nefﬁcient CNN to predict the scale distribution histogram of the\\nfaces and took this histogram to guide the zoom-in and zoom-\\nout of the image [171]. Since the faces are approximately\\nin uniform scale after zoom, compared with other state-of-\\nthe-art baselines, better performance is achieved with less\\ncomputation cost. Besides, some generic detection frameworks'),\n",

P EDESTRIAN DETECTION\\nRecently, pedestrian detection has been intensively studied,\\nwhich has a close relationship to pedestrian tracking [189],\\n[190], person re-identiﬁcation [191], [192] and robot naviga-\\ntion [193], [194]. Prior to the recent progress in DCNN based\\nmethods [195], [196], some researchers combined boosted\\ndecision forests with hand-crafted features to obtain pedestrian\\ndetectors [197]–[199]. At the same time, to explicitly model\\nthe deformation and occlusion, part-based models [200] and\\nexplicit occlusion handling [201], [202] are of concern.\\nAs there are many pedestrian instances of small sizes\\nin typical scenarios of pedestrian detection (e.g. automatic\\ndriving and intelligent surveillance), the application of RoI\\npooling layer in generic object detection pipeline may result\\nin ‘plain’ features due to collapsing bins. In the meantime, the\\nmain source of false predictions in pedestrian detection is the\\nconfusion of hard background instances, which is in contrast\\nto the interference from multiple categories in generic object\\ndetection. As a result, different conﬁgurations and components\\nare required to accomplish accurate pedestrian detection.\\nA. Deep learning in Pedestrian Detection\\nAlthough DCNNs have obtained excellent performance on\\ngeneric object detection [16], [72], none of these approaches\\nhave achieved better results than the best hand-crafted feature\\nbased method [198] for a long time, even when part-based\\ninformation and occlusion handling are incorporated [202].\\nThereby, some researches have been conducted to analyze the\\nreasons. Zhang et al. attempted to adapt generic Faster R-CNN\\n[18] to pedestrian detection [203]. They modiﬁed the down-\\nstream classiﬁer by adding boosted forests to shared, high-\\nresolution conv feature maps and taking a RPN to handle small\\ninstances and hard negative examples. To deal with complex\\nocclusions existing in pedestrian images, inspired by DPM\\n[24], Tian et al. proposed a deep learning framework called\\nDeepParts [204], which makes decisions based an ensemble of\\nextensive part detectors. DeepParts has advantages in dealing\\nwith weakly labeled data, low IoU positive proposals and\\npartial occlusion.\\nOther researchers also tried to combine complementary in-\\nformation from multiple data sources. CompACT-Deep adopts\\na complexity-aware cascade to combine hand-crafted features\\nand ﬁne-tuned DCNNs [195]. Based on Faster R-CNN, Liu et\\nal. proposed multi-spectral deep neural networks for pedestrian\\ndetection to combine complementary information from color\\nand thermal images [205]. Tian et al. [206] proposed a task-\\nassistant CNN (TA-CNN) to jointly learn multiple tasks with\\nTABLE VII\\nDETAILED BREAKDOWN PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS OF\\nSTATE-OF-THE -ART MODELS ON CALTECH PEDESTRIAN DATASET .

From this table,\\nwe observe that different from other tasks, classic handcrafted\\nfeatures can still earn competitive results with boosted decision\\nforests [203], ACF [197] and HOG+LUV channels [S2]. As\\nan early attempt to adapt CNN to pedestrian detection, the\\nfeatures generated by SCF+AlexNet are not so discriminant\\nand produce relatively poor results. Based on multiple CNNs,\\nDeepParts and CompACT-Deep accomplish detection tasks via\\ndifferent strategies, namely local part integration and cascade\\nnetwork. The responses from different local part detectors\\nmake DeepParts robust to partial occlusions. However, due to\\ncomplexity, it is too time-consuming to achieve real-time de-\\ntection. The multi-scale representation of MS-CNN improves\\naccuracy of pedestrian locations. SA-FastRCNN extends Fast\\nR-CNN to automatically detecting pedestrians according to\\ntheir different scales, which has trouble when there are partial\\nocclusions. RPN+BF combines the detectors produced by\\nFaster R-CNN with boosting decision forest to accurately\\nlocate different pedestrians. F-DNN+SS, which is composed\\nof multiple parallel classiﬁers with soft rejections, performs\\nthe best followed by RPN+BF, SA-FastRCNN and MS-CNN.\\nIn short, CNN based methods can provide more accurate\\ncandidate boxes and multi-level semantic information for\\nidentifying and locating pedestrians. Meanwhile, handcrafted\\nfeatures are complementary and can be combined with CNN\\nto achieve better results. The improvements over existing CNN\\nmethods can be obtained by carefully designing the framework\\nand classiﬁers, extracting multi-scale and part based semantic\\ninformation and searching for complementary information\\nfrom other related tasks, such as segmentation.\\nVII. P ROMISING FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND TASKS\\nIn spite of rapid development and achieved promising\\nprogress of object detection, there are still many open issues\\nfor future work.\\nThe ﬁrst one is small object detection such as occurring\\nin COCO dataset and in face detection task. To improve\\nlocalization accuracy on small objects under partial occlusions,\\nit is necessary to modify network architectures from the\\nfollowing aspects.\\n• Multi-task joint optimization and multi-modal infor-\\nmation fusion. Due to the correlations between different\\ntasks within and outside object detection, multi-task joint\\noptimization has already been studied by many researchers\\n[16] [18]. However, apart from the tasks mentioned in\\nSubs. III-A8, it is desirable to think over the characteristics\\nof different sub-tasks of object detection (e.g. superpixel\\nsemantic segmentation in salient object detection) and ex-\\ntend multi-task optimization to other applications such as\\ninstance segmentation [66], multi-object tracking [202] and\\nmulti-person pose estimation [S4]. Besides, given a speciﬁc\\napplication, the information from different modalities, such\\nas text [212], thermal data [205] and images [65], can be\\nfused together to achieve a more discriminant network.\\n•Scale adaption. Objects usually exist in different scales,\\nwhich is more apparent in face detection and pedestrian\\ndetection. To increase the robustness to scale changes, it\\nis demanded to train scale-invariant, multi-scale or scale-\\nadaptive detectors. For scale-invariant detectors, more pow-\\nerful backbone architectures (e.g. ResNext [123]), negative\\nsample mining [113], reverse connection [213] and sub-\\ncategory modelling [60] are all beneﬁcial. For multi-scale\\ndetectors, both the FPN [66] which produces multi-scale\\nfeature maps and Generative Adversarial Network [214]\\nwhich narrows representation differences between small ob-\\njects and the large ones with a low-cost architecture provide\\ninsights into generating meaningful feature pyramid. For\\nscale-adaptive detectors, it is useful to combine knowledge\\ngraph [215], attentional mechanism [216], cascade network\\n[180] and scale distribution estimation [171] to detect ob-\\njects adaptively.\\n•Spatial correlations and contextual modelling. Spatial\\ndistribution plays an important role in object detection. So\\nregion proposal generation and grid regression are taken\\nto obtain probable object locations. However, the corre-\\nlations between multiple proposals and object categories\\nare ignored. Besides, the global structure information is\\nabandoned by the position-sensitive score maps in R-FCN.\\nTo solve these problems, we can refer to diverse subset\\nselection [217] and sequential reasoning tasks [218] for\\npossible solutions. It is also meaningful to mask salient parts\\nand couple them with the global structure in a joint-learning\\nmanner [219].\\nThe second one is to release the burden on manual labor and\\naccomplish real-time object detection, with the emergence of\\nlarge-scale image and video data. The following three aspects\\ncan be taken into account.\\n•Cascade network. In a cascade network, a cascade of\\ndetectors are built in different stages or layers [180], [220].\\nAnd easily distinguishable examples are rejected at shallow\\nlayers so that features and classiﬁers at latter stages can\\nhandle more difﬁcult samples with the aid of the decisions\\nfrom previous stages. However, current cascades are built in\\na greedy manner, where previous stages in cascade are ﬁxed\\nwhen training a new stage. So the optimizations of different\\nCNNs are isolated, which stresses the necessity of end-to-\\nend optimization for CNN cascade. At the same time, it\\nis also a matter of concern to build contextual associated\\ncascade networks with existing layers.\\n• Unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. It’s\\nvery time consuming to manually draw large quantities\\nof bounding boxes. To release this burden, semantic prior\\n[55], unsupervised object discovery [221], multiple instance\\nlearning [222] and deep neural network prediction [47] can\\nbe integrated to make best use of image-level supervision to\\nassign object category tags to corresponding object regions\\nand reﬁne object boundaries. Furthermore, weakly annota-\\ntions (e.g. center-click annotations [223]) are also helpful\\nfor achieving high-quality detectors with modest annotation\\nefforts, especially aided by the mobile platform.\\n• Network optimization. Given speciﬁc applications and\\nplatforms, it is signiﬁcant to make a balance among speed,'),\n",

However, despite that detection\\naccuracy is reduced, it is more meaningful to learn compact\\nmodels with fewer number of parameters [209]. And this\\nsituation can be relieved by introducing better pre-training\\nschemes [225], knowledge distillation [226] and hint learn-\\ning [227]. DSOD also provides a promising guideline to\\ntrain from scratch to bridge the gap between different image\\nsources and tasks [74].\\nThe third one is to extend typical methods for 2D object de-\\ntection to adapt 3D object detection and video object detection,\\nwith the requirements from autonomous driving, intelligent\\ntransportation and intelligent surveillance.\\n•3D object detection. With the applications of 3D sensors\\n(e.g. LIDAR and camera), additional depth information can\\nbe utilized to better understand the images in 2D and extend\\nthe image-level knowledge to the real world. However,\\nseldom of these 3D-aware techniques aim to place correct\\n3D bounding boxes around detected objects. To achieve\\nbetter bounding results, multi-view representation [181] and\\n3D proposal network [228] may provide some guidelines to\\nencode depth information with the aid of inertial sensors\\n(accelerometer and gyrometer) [229].\\n• Video object detection. Temporal information across\\ndifferent frames play an important role in understanding\\nthe behaviors of different objects. However, the accuracy\\nsuffers from degenerated object appearances (e.g., motion\\nblur and video defocus) in videos and the network is\\nusually not trained end-to-end. To this end, spatiotemporal\\ntubelets [230], optical ﬂow [199] and LSTM [107] should\\nbe considered to fundamentally model object associations\\nbetween consecutive frames.\\nVIII. C ONCLUSION\\nDue to its powerful learning ability and advantages in\\ndealing with occlusion, scale transformation and background\\nswitches, deep learning based object detection has been a\\nresearch hotspot in recent years. This paper provides a detailed\\nreview on deep learning based object detection frameworks\\nwhich handle different sub-problems, such as occlusion, clutter\\nand low resolution, with different degrees of modiﬁcations\\non R-CNN. The review starts on generic object detection\\npipelines which provide base architectures for other related\\ntasks. Then, three other common tasks, namely salient object\\ndetection, face detection and pedestrian detection, are also\\nbrieﬂy reviewed. Finally, we propose several promising future\\ndirections to gain a thorough understanding of the object\\ndetection landscape. This review is also meaningful for the\\ndevelopments in neural networks and related learning systems,\\nwhich provides valuable insights and guidelines for future\\nprogress.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThis research was supported by the National Natural Sci-\\nence Foundation of China (No.61672203 & 61375047 &\\n91746209), the National Key Research and Development Pro-\\ngram of China (2016YFB1000901), and Anhui Natural Sci-\\nence Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar (No.170808J08).\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] P.
